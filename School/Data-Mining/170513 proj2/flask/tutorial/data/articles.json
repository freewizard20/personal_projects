[{"author": "Anna Fifield", "content": "TOKYO \u2014 With the kind of fanfare that only a totalitarian state can muster, North Korea on Saturday flaunted missiles that can theoretically reach the United States and defiantly stated that it was prepared to counter any U.S. attack with \u201ca nuclear war of our own.\u201d\n\nBut it soon looked like a case of style over substance. North Korea somewhat ruined the impression created with the parade, which took place on the most important day of the year for Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime, with a failed missile launch Sunday morning.\n\nThe ballistic missile was fired from the Sinpo area on the east coast shortly before 6 a.m. local time, U.S. Pacific Command said. It blew up almost immediately, complicating efforts to identify the missile\u2019s size and range.\nNorth Korea fired a land-based version of its medium-range, submarine-launched ballistic missile from the same area earlier this month. That exercise also failed.\n\nThe missile was fired just minutes after Vice President Pence took off from Alaska on his way to Seoul, where he is expected to issue a strong warning to North Korea to stop its provocative behavior or face consequences.\n\nPence was briefed on North Korea\u2019s failed missile launch within an hour of departing from Anchorage, where Air Force Two stopped to refuel. He was in contact with President Trump, aides told reporters traveling with the vice president.\nAs tensions with North Korea escalated heading into the weekend, Trump spent Friday and Saturday mornings golfing at his private club in West Palm Beach, Fla., greeting members after he returned from the green, according to someone who saw him.\n\nThe president seemed to be hoping for a calm weekend. He was joined on his trip by just three junior staffers and K.T. McFarland, a deputy national security adviser who was recently pushed out and made ambassador to Singapore as a consolation. Many of Trump\u2019s White House aides were given the weekend off.\nTrump had nothing to say about the launch, said Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis. \u201cThe president and his military team are aware of North Korea\u2019s most recent unsuccessful missile launch,\u201d Mattis said in a statement. \u201cThe president has no further comment.\u201d\n\nThe missile was launched into the sea off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula, where a U.S. Navy strike group is patrolling. Military commanders ordered the group, led by the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, to the area this month as tensions with North Korea mounted.\n\nThe group has the ability to shoot down incoming missiles and launch missiles of its own.\n\nAlthough the missile in Sunday\u2019s attempt \u2014 like others before it \u2014 exploded shortly after launch, experts warn that North Korea\u2019s rocket scientists learn something from failures as well as successes, giving them information they can use to hone their technology.\nCertainly, the military hardware paraded through Pyongyang on Saturday shows that Kim is unrelenting in his quest to develop a missile capable of reaching the United States.\n\nExperts were stunned at the sheer number of new missiles on display during the parade \u2014 including, apparently, a new and previously unknown type of intercontinental ballistic missile. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like not doing a nuclear test was good news \u2014 this is all part of the same program,\u201d said Jeffrey Lewis, head of the East Asia program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California. North Korea has claimed to be able to make nuclear weapons small enough to be able to fit on a missile. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re saying: \u2018Hey, here\u2019s some other bad news,\u2019 \u201d Lewis said. \n\nThe two-hour-long parade took place on a day officially known as the \u201cDay of the Sun,\u201d the anniversary of the 1912 birth of Kim Il Sung, North Korea\u2019s founder and the current leader\u2019s grandfather. \n\nA relaxed Kim Jong Un stood smiling on a balcony as untold tens of thousands of soldiers marched past, planes in a formation making 105 \u2014 for the anniversary \u2014 flew overhead and missile transporters rolled through the square in front of him. \n\nHe did not look like a man worried about a strike ordered by Trump, like that in Syria earlier this month, or concerned about China\u2019s increasing anger over his belligerence. \n\n[ Here are the missiles North Korea just showed off, one by one. ]\n\n\u201cWe will respond to an all-out war with an all-out war and a nuclear war of our own,\u201d Choe Ryong Hae, one of Kim\u2019s top aides, said in a speech at the parade, as the 33-year-old leader looked on. \n\nKim said in his New Year\u2019s address that North Korea was in the \u201cfinal stage\u201d of preparations to test-launch an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. That prompted Trump to tweet in response: \u201cIt won\u2019t happen!\u201d \n\nBut Kim appeared to demonstrate Saturday that he is in the process of making it happen.  \n\nNorth Korea has previously shown off at these parades two kinds of ICBMs, the KN-08 and the KN-14, both with the theoretical capacity to reach the U.S. mainland. \n\nSaturday\u2019s parade included the same vehicles as in the past, but instead of carrying missiles they were carrying huge, previously unseen missile canisters. Those could have contained the KN-08 and KN-14, or something else \u2014 or nothing at all. \n\nBut the message was clear. \n\n\u201cThis was a promise of future capabilities more than a demonstration of existing missiles,\u201d said Joe Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund, which tries to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. \u201cWe do not know if there is actually an ICBM in that canister. But it is certainly coming.\u201d \n\nFurthermore, the canisters are probably an indication that North Korea is pressing ahead with \u00adsolid-fuel technology, because canisters are used to keep the temperature stable for solid-fuel missiles.  \n\n[ North Korea\u2019s display of new missiles is worrying, analysts say ]\n\nBy using solid fuel, North Korea can roll out its missiles from a hangar or tunnel ready to launch, rather than having to fuel them on a gantry like the older liquid-\nfueled rockets. That allows much less time for the missiles to be detected by satellites.  \n\nNorth Korea has been using this technology for its submarine-launched ballistic missile, which Kim boasted was \u201cthe greatest success,\u201d and the land-based variant, tested earlier this month but less successfully. Both types of missiles were displayed in the parade Saturday. \n\nIn addition, although experts were continuing to analyze footage, it appeared that North Korea had shown off a third and previously unknown ICBM.  \n\nThe black-and-white missiles looked like KN-08s but were slightly smaller. They were rolled out on vehicles usually used for the medium-range Musudan missile, which North Korea tested a barrage of last year. \n\nIn January, South Korea\u2019s Yonhap News Agency reported, citing military officials, that North \u00adKorea had probably built a new ICBM that was less than 50 feet long. The black-and-white missile seen Saturday was consistent with that description, experts said. \n\nBut rather than being concerned that North Korea potentially had a new weapon that could reach the United States, \u00adMichael Elleman, senior fellow for missile defense at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, saw something encouraging. \n\n\u201cThis could signal some confusion in terms of where they want to go with their long-range systems,\u201d he said, noting that it could mean North Korea has not finalized the design of its ICBM. \n\n[ Will North Korea fire a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland? Probably. ]\n\nElleman said he could not believe that North Korea had been able to master the technology necessary to launch even one stage of a two- or three-stage ICBM. \n\n\u201cUntil they\u2019ve fixed the Musudan, they\u2019re not going to get anywhere,\u201d he said. North Korea launched a series of medium-range Musudan missiles last year \u2014 thought to be designed to become a stage in an ICBM \u2014 and all but one failed. \n\nNorth Korea has never launched an ICBM, but given how difficult the technology is, it would almost certainly fail on its first test, experts say. \n\nMarkus Schiller, a German aerospace engineer who specializes in missiles, also cast doubts on how much progress North Korea was making.  \n\n\u201cThe Soviets tried to build a solid-fuel missile and it took them more than 15 years to get it up and running,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t just get a solid-fuel missile overnight.\u201d \n\nBut even if North Korea does not yet have the technical capacity to launch a missile capable of reaching the United States, it has clearly demonstrated that it has the political will. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alarming that they are pouring so much money and resources into this program,\u201d Elleman said. \u201cEventually, they are going to be successful.\u201d   \n\nAshley Parker in West Palm Beach, Fla., contributed to this report.", "title": "N.

Officers confiscated knives and makeshift weapons.\n\nThe demonstrations came just days before Tuesday\u2019s deadline for taxpayers to file their returns. Trump was the first major-party nominee in more than 40 years not to release his tax returns, saying it was because he was under audit. He later said that voters don\u2019t care.\n\nBut 71-year-old Ilene Singh said he\u2019s wrong. She rode a bus from New Jersey to New York City with her friend Geraldine Markowitz, 83, to take part in protests. \u201cWe\u2019re here to say we care,\u201d said Singh.\n\nPushing her walker, Karin Arlin, 85, a Holocaust survivor who came to the U.S. from Germany when she was 9, said she\u2019s also worried about the direction of the country.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know which way the country goes,\u201d said Arlin next to her 89-year-old husband who fled Czechoslovakia during World War II. \u201cI hope Republicans see it.\u201d\n\nProtesters in Raleigh, North Carolina, said they suspect that Trump\u2019s returns might show he has paid little or nothing to the government he now heads, or that he was indebted to Russian, Chinese or other foreign interests.\n\n\u201cHis reputation ... as a businessman and, more importantly, as a true American, a person who is concerned with American values, would be totally destroyed if all his financial information was made public,\u201d said Mike Mannshardt, a retired teacher.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s sharpest critics in the House spoke to protesters at the U.S. Capitol just before they set off on a march to the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, of California, said there\u2019s nothing to prevent Trump from releasing his income taxes and that \u201cthe simple truth is he\u2019s got a lot to hide.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he thinks he can get away with playing king, he\u2019s got another thought coming,\u201d Waters said.\n\nNancy Traver, of Silver Spring, Maryland, who was at the Washington march said, \u201cEvery president, Democratic and Republican for years has showed, has revealed his tax returns, so why shouldn\u2019t Trump?\u201d\n\nFor four decades, presidents and major party nominees have released some of their tax returns, with the exception of Gerald Ford. Trump\u2019s break with precedent has raised questions about possible conflicts of interest.\n\nDemocrats are pushing for a vote on a bill from Rep. Anna Eshoo, a Democrat from California, which would require the president and all major-party nominees to publicly disclose their previous three years of tax returns with the Office of Government Ethics or the Federal Election Commission.\n\nRepublicans also have rebuffed Democrats\u2019 efforts to get the House Ways and Means Committee to act. It has legal authority to obtain confidential tax records, and could vote to make them public.\n\nMany demonstrators said they hoped Saturday\u2019s marches would convince Trump to voluntarily release them.\n\n\u201cWe do care. We want to see his taxes,\u201d said Ann Demerlis, who was among hundreds who marched in Philadelphia from City Hall to an area in front of historic Independence Hall, carrying signs and chanting \u201cWe want your taxes now!\u201d\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

People reported seeing a dark-colored sport utility vehicle near where the jogger, Vanessa Marcotte, 27, died. Witness accounts and DNA retrieved from her hands suggested the killer might be a Hispanic man about 30 years old.\n\nThose clues came together last week when a state trooper in Worcester spotted a man matching that description driving the same kind of vehicle.

Lehren", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump is populating the White House and federal agencies with former lobbyists, lawyers and consultants who in many cases are helping to craft new policies for the same industries in which they recently earned a paycheck.\n\nThe potential conflicts are arising across the executive branch, according to an analysis of recently released financial disclosures, lobbying records and interviews with current and former ethics officials by The New York Times in collaboration with ProPublica.\n\nIn at least two cases, the appointments may have already led to violations of the administration\u2019s own ethics rules. But evaluating if and when such violations have occurred has become almost impossible because the Trump administration is secretly issuing waivers to the rules.\n\nOne such case involves Michael Catanzaro, who serves as the top White House energy adviser. Until late last year, he was working as a lobbyist for major industry clients such as Devon Energy of Oklahoma, an oil and gas company, and Talen Energy of Pennsylvania, a coal-burning electric utility, as they fought Obama-era environmental regulations, including the landmark Clean Power Plan. Now, he is handling some of the same matters on behalf of the federal government.\n\nAnother case involves Chad Wolf, who spent the past several years lobbying to secure funding for the Transportation Security Administration to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a new carry-on luggage screening device. He is now chief of staff at that agency \u2014 at the same time as the device is being tested and evaluated for possible purchase by agency staff.\n\nThere are other examples. At the Labor Department, two officials joined the agency from the K Street lobbying corridor, leaving behind jobs where they fought some of the Obama administration\u2019s signature labor rules, including a policy requiring financial advisers to act in a client\u2019s best interest when providing retirement advice.\n\nThis revolving door of lobbyists and government officials is not new in Washington. Both parties make a habit of it.\n\nBut the Trump administration is more vulnerable to conflicts than the prior administration, particularly after the president eliminated an ethics provision that prohibits lobbyists from joining agencies they lobbied in the prior two years. The White House also announced on Friday that it would keep its visitors\u2019 logs secret, discontinuing the release of information on corporate executives, lobbyists and others who enter the complex, often to try to influence federal policy. The changes have drawn intense criticism from government ethics advocates across the city.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s appointees are also far wealthier and have more complex financial holdings and private-sector ties than officials hired at the start of the Obama administration, according to an Office of Government Ethics analysis that the White House has made public. This creates a greater chance that they might have conflicts related to investments or former clients, which could force them to sell off assets, recuse themselves or seek a waiver.\n\nA White House spokeswoman, Sarah H. Sanders, declined repeated requests by The Times to speak with Stefan C. Passantino, the White House lawyer in charge of the ethics policy. Instead, the White House provided a written statement that did not address any of the specific questions about potential violations The Times had identified.\n\nPhoto\n\nMichael Catanzaro, the White House\u2019s top energy adviser, lobbied for clients fighting Obama-era environmental regulations, including Talen Energy and Devon Energy (whose well site is pictured). Credit From left: Nick Oxford/Reuters; Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call, via Associated Press\n\u201cThe White House takes its ethics pledge and federal conflict of interest rules very seriously,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe White House requires all of its employees to work closely with ethics counsel to ensure compliance and has aggressively required employees to recuse or divest where the law requires.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s overhaul of personnel lays the groundwork for sweeping policy changes. The president has vowed to unwind some of the Obama administration\u2019s signature regulatory initiatives, from Wall Street rules to environmental regulations, and he has installed a class of former corporate influencers to lead the push. Administration supporters argue that appointees with corporate ties can inject a new level of sophistication into the federal bureaucracy and help the economy grow. And efforts to trim regulations in some areas have attracted bipartisan support.\n\nBut in several cases, officials in the Trump administration now hold the exact jobs they targeted as lobbyists or lawyers in the past two years.\n\nTrump White House officials had over 300 recent corporate clients and employers, including Apple, the giant hedge fund Citadel and the insurance titan Anthem, according to a Times analysis of financial disclosures. (The White House has released disclosures for only about half of its roughly 180 current senior political employees.) And there are more than 40 former lobbyists in the White House and the broader federal government.\n\nExceptions Made in Secret\n\nWalter M. Shaub Jr. is director of the Office of Government Ethics, which advises federal agencies to help them and their employees \u2014 including the White House \u2014 comply with federal ethics laws, such as a prohibition on using a government post to personally profit.\n\nHe said that Mr. Trump\u2019s own ethics executive order in late January eliminated a requirement, first adopted by President Barack Obama, that executive branch appointees not accept jobs in agencies they recently lobbied. That weakened standards applying to approximately 4,000 executive branch hires.\n\nMr. Trump also made it easier for former lobbyists in the government to get waivers that would let them take up matters that could benefit former clients.\n\nDuring the Obama administration, these waivers were given only under a narrow set of circumstances, and had to be filed and explained in an annual report for public inspection, Mr. Shaub said. The waivers were also previously posted on the Government Ethics website. None have been posted since Mr. Trump became president, as sharing them is no longer required.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no transparency, and I have no idea how many waivers have been issued,\u201d Mr. Shaub said in an interview, adding that he could not comment on any individual matter until a complaint had been filed and investigated.\n\nThe granting of such waivers, he said, has become \u201ca political decision, which means career government ethics officials should not get involved in waivers under the new executive order.\u201d\n\nAfter recent negotiations, Mr. Shaub and the White House Counsel\u2019s Office did agree on how to define the requirements and scope of recusal obligations. A lobbyist, for example, who pushed the Obama administration to approve or block a particular provision in a proposed federal regulation affecting a specific industry \u2014 like coal or telecommunications \u2014 would be subject to a broad ban under this agreement. \u201cShe must recuse for two years from development and implementation of the entire regulation,\u201d the legal advisory said.\n\nPhoto\n\nChad Wolf is the chief of staff for the T.S.A.

Mr. Catanzaro was registered for Talen Energy on the Clean Power Plan in 2015, yet he has worked in recent months as a senior member of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council trying to roll back that rule, adopted by the Obama administration.\n\nMr. Catanzaro\u2019s former clients, such as Talen and Devon Energy, have an enormous amount at stake in the regulations the White House is preparing to reverse \u2014 with his help. Talen, for example, helps operate the Colstrip power plant in Montana, the second-largest coal-burning plant west of the Mississippi. Federal officials have estimated that the plant could face a $1.2 billion bill as it makes updates to meet the new environmental standards, assuming it is not just closed.\n\nThree industry lobbyists interviewed by The Times said that they recently had confidential conversations with Mr. Catanzaro about some of the same regulatory matters on which he was lobbying the federal government. And Mr. Catanzaro gave a briefing to reporters in March at the White House in which he discussed energy topics at length, including the details related to the executive order Mr. Trump signed on March 28 to weaken the Clean Power Plan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly true that there a lot of different forces that conspire to affect the coal industry, the gas industry, a lot of industries,\u201d Mr. Catanzaro said at a White House briefing last month in which he spoke with the understanding that journalists would not identify him in their reports. (The Times independently confirmed that Mr. Catanzaro made these remarks.) \u201cCertainly government policy has a role,\u201d he said. \u201cSo to the extent the president can have a beneficial effect on that policy, he\u2019s going to take it.\u201d\n\nMr. Catanzaro did not respond to emails and phone calls requesting comment. And White House officials would not say whether he had been granted a waiver allowing him to be involved in the same matter he handled as a lobbyist.\n\nSame Desk, New Seat\n\nMr. Catanzaro is not the only senior adviser facing potential conflicts on the National Economic Council, the White House office, run by the former Goldman Sachs executive Gary D. Cohn, that helps steer the president\u2019s financial and economic policy. D. J. Gribbin, the council\u2019s infrastructure specialist, previously worked for Macquarie, a bank that specializes in infrastructure deals and that stands to gain from whatever infrastructure proposal the president gets Congress to fund.\n\nShahira Knight, on the council as well, is a special assistant to the president for tax and retirement policy. Her previous job also involved retirement policy \u2014 but as a lobbyist for Fidelity, one of the nation\u2019s largest fund managers and providers of retirement products.\n\nAt Fidelity, lobbying records show, she was registered to work on retirement issues, including the so-called fiduciary rule, which has broad support from consumer groups. It requires financial firms to act in a client\u2019s best interest when dispensing retirement advice. Fidelity has said it supports the \u201cbest interest\u201d standard but, like other firms, has raised concerns that the rule will prevent investors from accessing products they currently rely on for retirement savings.\n\nMs. Knight directed some of her appeals to the National Economic Council, her current employer. White House visitor logs show she met with the person whose job she essentially holds now.\n\nIn February, Mr. Trump issued a memorandum directing the Labor Department to review whether the rule may \u201cadversely affect\u201d investors\u2019 ability to access financial advice \u2014 and if it does, it authorized the agency to rescind or revise the rule. The department recently delayed the compliance date of the rule by two months, less than the industry had hoped for.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment about Mr. Gribbin or Ms. Knight, so it is unclear whether they received waivers letting them work on these issues or recused themselves from issues affecting their former employers. But under Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, Ms. Knight should probably be barred for two years from participating in decisions that would affect the fiduciary rule.\n\nPhoto\n\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, the nominee to lead the F.D.A., received more than $350,000 in payments in 2014 and 2015 from nearly a dozen different pharmaceutical companies. Credit Eric Thayer for The New York Times\nWhere Lobbyists Go\n\nThe lobbyist loophole in Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order may have allowed the Labor Department to hire Geoffrey Burr as a special assistant. The department is familiar ground to Mr. Burr, who was a lobbyist for the Associated Builders and Contractors, which pressed the agency on its overtime pay rule, wage requirements for government contracts and an additional half-dozen or so other regulations. Under Mr. Obama\u2019s ethics order, Mr. Burr would probably not have been able to join the Labor Department.\n\nSuch potential conflicts are showing up across the federal government.\n\nExecutives at Analogic Corp. had tried to sell its carry-on baggage security equipment to the T.S.A. with Mr. Wolf\u2019s help when he was a lobbyist. They were pressing the agency to conduct formal tests of its computed tomography devices, known as CT scans, which are already used broadly in the medical field and on checked baggage. The company now wants the T.S.A. to use them in the nation\u2019s 2,400 airport checkpoint security lanes, a move that could be worth at least $500 million in equipment sales.\n\nThe tests are underway, and at one point during an interview with The Times, company executives said they had reached out to Mr. Wolf to discuss the matter after he joined the T.S.A., listing his name among a series of agency officials they had recently contacted. But when asked again about Mr. Wolf, they would not give details from the conversation, at one point contradicting themselves and saying they had not spoken with him. Then one of them, Mark Laustra, a vice president at Analogic who leads the company\u2019s efforts to sell the screening devices, said, \u201cOur interaction with Chad since he joined T.S.A. has been next to nothing.\u201d\n\nMr. Wolf\u2019s Twitter account on Friday still identified him as a lobbyist and displayed posts from last year urging the T.S.A. to buy the devices. \u201cPositive developments from TSA on upgrading checkpoint scanners,\u201d a post from July said. \u201cCT tech is the future.\u201d\n\nA T.S.A. spokesman agreed to arrange an interview with Mr. Wolf \u2014 who worked at the agency during the Bush administration before becoming a lobbyist \u2014 but canceled it when told about the topic in detail.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid Mr. Wolf isn\u2019t going to have any available time in his schedule today,\u201d said Mike England, the spokesman, who then declined several follow-up requests over a one-week period. He later added, in a statement, that Mr. Wolf\u2019s \u201cduties have not required a waiver\u201d of the ethics standards Mr. Trump adopted in January, although Mr. England would not discuss the matter further.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has become another source of potential conflicts.\n\nLance Leggitt, who serves as chief of staff to Tom Price, the health and human services secretary, worked last year as a lobbyist for 10 different health care companies, including United States Medical Supply and Advanced Infusion Services. He focused largely on lobbying the agency related to Medicare billing rules, as well as rules for health care supplier accreditations, lobbying disclosure reports show. All these issues are routinely handled by the agency he helps oversee.\n\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, the nominee to lead the Food and Drug Administration, received more than $350,000 in payments in 2014 and 2015 from nearly a dozen different pharmaceutical companies, including Vertex Pharmaceuticals, whose two approved drugs are seen as breakthrough treatments for cystic fibrosis. (They carry list prices of more than $250,000 a year.) Dr. Gottlieb, who has never been registered as a lobbyist but has served as the director of eight pharmaceutical companies and one laboratory company, wrote in a letter that he was prepared to recuse himself as necessary to avoid any conflicts.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for a comment.\n\nDanielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, said the sheer number of potential conflicts \u2014 which will require recusals, necessitate waivers or result in violations of the ethics rule \u2014 is disturbing, particularly given the secretive approach the administration is taking on the issue.\n\n\u201cThis is not a matter of just checking a box \u2014 this is about protecting the integrity of the operation of federal government,\u201d Ms. Brian said. \u201cBut our worst fears are coming true: We know people coming in who have conflicts, and we cannot see what restrictions they are under, if any.\u201d\n\nThe result, she predicted, might serve no one particularly well. Even if the rules are enforced, so many senior officials will be required to recuse themselves that \u201cthey will have a hard time getting their job done.\u201d", "title": "With Trump Appointees, a Raft of Potential Conflicts and \u2018No Transparency\u2019", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/15/us/politics/trump-appointees-potential-conflicts.html", "id": 6, "media": "New York Times", "datetime": "2017/04/16 00:32"}, {"author": "Sarah El Deeb and Philip Issa", "content": "BEIRUT \u2014 A stalled population transfer resumed Saturday after a deadly explosion killed at least 100, including children, government supporters and opposition fighters, at an evacuation point \u2014 adding new urgency to the widely criticized operation.\n\nThe blast ripped through a bus depot in the al-Rashideen area where thousands of government loyalists evacuated the day before waited restlessly for hours, as opposition fighters guarded the area while negotiators bickered over the completion of the transfer deal. Only meters away, hundreds of evacuees from pro-rebels areas also loitered in a walled-off parking lot, guarded by government troops.\n\nFootage from the scene showed bodies, including those of fighters, lying alongside buses, some of which were charred and others gutted from the blast. Personal belongings could be seen dangling out of the windows. Fires raged from a number of vehicles as rescuers struggled to put them out.\n\nThe scenes were the last in the unyielding bloodshed Syrians are living through. Earlier this month, at least 89 people were killed in a chemical attack as children foaming at the mouth and adults gasping for last breath were also caught on camera.\n\nThe bloody mayhem that followed the Saturday attack only deepened the resentment of the transfer criticized as population engineering. It also reflected the chaos surrounding negotiations between the warring parties. The United Nations did not oversee the transfer deal of the villages of Foua and Kfraya, besieged by the rebels, and Madaya and Zabadani, encircled by the government.\n\nNo one claimed responsibility for the attack but pro-government media and the opposition exchanged accusations, each pointing to foreign interference or conspiracies undermining the deal.\n\nState TV al-Ikhbariya said the attack was the result of a car bomb carrying food aid to be delivered to the evacuees in the rebel-held area \u2014 ostensibly crisps for the children \u2014 and accused rebel groups of carrying it out. A TV broadcaster from the area said: \u201cThere can be no life with the terrorist groups.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know nothing of my family. I can\u2019t find them,\u201d said a woman who appeared on al-Ikhbariya, weeping outside the state hospital in Aleppo where the wounded were transported.\n\nAhrar al-Sham, the rebel group that negotiated the deal, denounced the \u201ccowardly\u201d attack, saying a number of opposition fighters as well as government supporters were killed in the attack. The group said the attack only serves to deflect the attention from government \u201ccrimes\u201d and said it was ready to cooperate with an international probe to determine who did it.\n\nYasser Abdelatif, a media official for Ahrar al-Sham, said about 30 rebel gunmen were killed in the blast. He accused the government or extremist rebel groups of orchestrating the attack to discredit the opposition.\n\nThe Syrian Civil Defense in Aleppo province, also known as the White Helmets, said their volunteers pulled at least 100 bodies from the site of the explosion. White Helmets member Ibrahim Alhaj said the 100 fatalities documented by the rescuers included many children and women, as well as fighters.\n\nSyrian state media said at least 39 were killed, including children. The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll at 43, adding that it would likely rise because of the extensive damage. A Facebook page belonging to the pro-government Foua and Kfraya villages said all those in three buses were killed or are still missing while a rebel official said at least 30 opposition fighters who were guarding the evacuees were killed in the blast.\n\nAccording to Abdul Hakim Baghdadi, an interlocutor who helped the government negotiate the evacuations, 140 were killed in the attack. He added it was not clear how many rebels were killed because they were evacuated to their areas.\n\nHours after the explosion, the transfer resumed \u2014 as dozens of buses, starting with the wounded, left to their respective destinations. Before midnight Saturday, 100 of some 120 buses from both sides had already arrived.\n\nThe explosion hit the al-Rashideen area, a rebel-controlled district outside Aleppo city where evacuation buses carrying nearly 5,000 people from the northern rebel-besieged villages of Foua and Kfraya were stuck. Residents from the two villages had been evacuated Friday, along with more than 2,000 from Madaya, an opposition-held town outside of Damascus besieged by government forces.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the attack Saturday in a statement from his spokesman Stephane Dujarric, and called on all parties \u201cto ensure the safety and security of those waiting to be evacuated.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose responsible for today\u2019s attack must be brought to justice,\u201d the statement added.\n\nThe coordinated evacuations delivered war-weary fighters and residents from two years of siege and hunger, but moved Syria closer to a division of its national population by loyalty and sect.\n\nMadaya and Zabadani, once summer resorts to Damascus, have been shattered under the cruelty of a government siege. The two towns rebelled against Damascus\u2019 authority in 2011 when demonstrations swept through the country demanding the end of President Bashar Assad\u2019s rule.\n\nResidents were reduced to hunting rodents and eating tree leaves. Photos of children gaunt with hunger shocked the world and gave new urgency to U.N. relief operations in Syria.\n\nFoua and Kfraya, besieged by the rebels, lived under a steady hail of rockets and mortars. They were supplied with food and medical supplies through military airdrops.\n\nCritics say the string of evacuations, which could see some 30,000 people moved across battle lines over the next 60 days, amounts to forced displacement along political and sectarian lines.\n\nThe explosion came as frustration was already mounting over the stalling evacuation process.\n\n\u201cThe situation is disastrous,\u201d said Ahmed Afandar, a resident evacuated from the opposition area near Madaya. \u201cAll these thousands of people are stuck in less than half a kilometer (500 yards).\u201d He said the area was walled off from all sides and there were no restrooms.\n\nAfandar said people were not allowed to leave the buses for a while before they were let out. Food was distributed after several hours and by early afternoon the evacuees from rebel-held areas were \u201cpressured\u201d to sit back on their buses, Afandar said.\n\nThe evacuees from Madaya headed to rebel-held Idlib, west of Aleppo. After the blast, evacuees from opposition areas pleaded for protection fearing revenge attacks.\n\nSyrian state TV blamed the rebels for obstructing the deal.\n\nAn opposition representative, Ali Diab, accused the government side of violating the terms of the agreement, by evacuating fewer armed men than agreed to from the pro-government areas.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The referendum comes at a moment of deep polarization in Turkey, in the wake of a failed coup last summer, with views of the powerful president eliciting sharply divergent views.\n\n People walk on campaign leaflets in Istanbul after the start of the election banning Saturday. (Bulent Kilic/AFP/Getty Images)\nThe referendum also comes as Turkey\u2019s Western allies, including the United States, are looking to Erdogan as an increasingly critical partner, which is leading a military coalition to defeat the Islamic State militant group in Iraq and Syria. Turkey also hosts more than 3 million refugees and has struck a deal with European nations to prevent more refugees from traveling to their shores.\n\nThere were questions about whether the referendum should have been held, with the country under a government-mandated state of emergency as a result of the coup attempt and a number of other recent shocks.\n\nA war between the state and Kurdish militants has rekindled after the failure of a peace process. Deadly attacks have been carried out in Turkish cities by the Islamic State, unnerving the public and troubling the economy.\n\nAnd, since the coup, the government has carried out a feverish purge of perceived enemies that has eviscerated state institutions, schools and universities. The purge has been accompanied by a crackdown on critical journalists, politicians and other civil society groups, which Erdogan\u2019s opponents said gave the government a significant advantage as it embarked on the referendum campaign.\n\nA leading opposition politician from the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party, or HDP, was arrested in November, denying the \u201cNo\u201d campaign one of its most visible and charismatic voices. As independent media outlets were shuttered or dragged into court, the AKP\u2019s campaign for \u201cEvet,\u201d or \u201cYes,\u201d dominated Turkey\u2019s airwaves as well as its public spaces.\n\nAt the same time, Turkey\u2019s political opposition has long been regarded as ineffectual and divided. And as a campaigner, Erdogan is widely credited with uncommon gifts. A centerpiece of his latest campaign was a pitched fight with European leaders that stirred up nationalist, anti-Western sentiment at home.\n\n\u201cHis populism is effective in large part because it is heartfelt,\u201d wrote Howard Eissenstat, a professor of history at St. Lawrence University, in a recent paper that was sharply critical of Erdogan and the proposed constitutional changes. \u201cAt the same time, he is capable of shockingly cynical calculations in the name of political survival.\u201d\n\n\u201cErdogan\u2019s genius as a politician, his flair for rhetoric, his capacity to mobilize his base, and his sense of himself as a \u2018man of history\u2019 have all served to put him at the center of Turkish politics for more than a decade,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOn the eve of the vote, Erdogan\u2019s supporters tried to drive home the arguments they have made throughout the campaign: that the constitutional changes were a remedy to weak coalition governments, an affliction with a long history in Turkey, and that foreign opposition to the changes, including from European leaders, were intended to hold the country back.\n\n\u201cThey do not support this because they do not want what is best for Turkey,\u201d said Muhammet Sirin, a spokesman for a local AKP party branch in Istanbul, speaking of Erdogan\u2019s foreign critics. \u201cThey are still acting with the mentality of the crusades. This nation has woken up, and we are going to stand on our feet now,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Duygu Becerik, a 22-year-old law student who was campaigning for the \u201cNo\u201d vote in Istanbul on Saturday, belonged to a generation that barely recalled the chaos of Turkey\u2019s flimsy coalition governments. Erdogan and the AKP had dominated the country\u2019s politics since she was a child.\n\nOne of her professors had been fired from her university as part of the post-coup purges. Her rejection of the constitutional changes is not just personally directed at Erdogan, but is based in part on the fear that Turkey was creating an exceptionally powerful executive, not just for the current president but forever.\n\n\u201cErdogan will eventually die. Other people will take power \u2014 exactly the same power \u2014 but we don\u2019t know who,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is problematic.\u201d", "title": "Turks to decide whether to give Erdogan vastly increased powers", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/turks-to-decide-whether-to-give-erdogan-vastly-increased-powers/2017/04/15/e79812b6-1bda-11e7-bcc2-7d1a0973e7b2_story.html", "id": 8, "media": "Washington Post", "datetime": "2017/04/16 00:01"}, {"author": "Mujib Mashal", "content": "KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The American military\u2019s use of the most powerful conventional bomb in its arsenal on an Islamic State cave complex in Afghanistan has stirred up political trouble for the Afghan government, as former President Hamid Karzai on Saturday called his successor \u201ca traitor\u201d and declared that he wanted the Americans gone from the country.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times, hours after he said he intended to work toward \u201cousting the U.S.,\u201d a fuming Mr. Karzai said there was no justification for the United States to drop the powerful bomb in Afghanistan. The weapon, the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast, is referred to as the \u201cmother of all bombs.\u201d\n\nHe accused the American military of using the presence of Islamic State militants to turn his country into a laboratory for testing its weapons.\n\nMr. Karzai called President Ashraf Ghani\u2019s government an \u201caccomplice\u201d that allowed and welcomed the use of the bomb. Mr. Ghani\u2019s government had said the attack, which was said to have killed dozens of militants and destroyed three large caves in Nangarhar Province, was coordinated with the United States.\n\n\u201cShame on him for saying that, shame, shame,\u201d Mr. Karzai said. \u201cNo Afghan with self-respect would do that.\u201d He added, \u201cHe is a traitor, a traitor.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Ghani would not address Mr. Karzai\u2019s harsh words directly. But Mr. Ghani\u2019s office put out a brief post on Twitter, clearly aimed at Mr. Karzai: \u201cEvery Afghan has the right to speak their mind. This is a country of free speech.\u201d\n\nThe uproar over the bombing and its meanings comes as H. R. McMaster, President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, arrived in Kabul on Saturday for consultations with Afghan leaders as the new administration reviews its Afghanistan policy.\n\nAfghan and American military officials described the bomb\u2019s use as a battlefield necessity for the destruction of the Islamic State cave complex and the success of military operations. Four ground operations in the area, supported by regular, smaller airstrikes, had proven futile, they say. There have been no signs yet that the bombing caused any civilian casualties.\n\nOther Afghan politicians have been more restrained about their views of the American bombing, with some opposed to it and others saying they supported it.\n\nAmin Karim, the spokesman for the main faction of Hezb-e-Islami, a conservative Islamist party with links to the insurgency, said members of his party disagreed with the strike because they believed it was carried out for American domestic political reasons and as a way to send a message to other countries at odds with the United States, rather than strictly to fight terrorism in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cThe goal of this attack was for beyond Afghanistan \u2014 it was for showing American power to North Korea, Syria and some other countries; it was for scaring these countries,\u201d Mr. Amin said.\n\nAt a news conference organized by the Nangarhar governor\u2019s office on Friday, a group of elders from the Achin district, where the bomb was dropped, expressed support for the use of such overwhelming force to eliminate the Islamic State fighters.\n\nAtta Muhammad Noor, the powerful governor of the northern Balkh Province and a leader of the Jamiat-e-Islami, one of the largest Islamist parties, said he supported the use of the bomb as well as any \u201ccrackdown on insurgents and fundamentalists.\u201d\n\nMr. Karzai said the people of eastern Afghanistan had expressed concern about Islamic State fighters crossing the border with Pakistan when the threat emerged more than two years ago, but little action was taken then. \u201cThey allowed Daesh to come and come, and empty villages of their residents and entrench themselves,\u201d he said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. \u201cWhy did they wait for two years? Why didn\u2019t they stop them then? All the entry points were known.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe conclusion is that Daesh was a U.S. contractor, like DynCorp, like other U.S. companies, that they used to empty an area of its population and create a cause, create an environment, a psychological environment in which the U.S. can then test its weapon.\u201d\n\nMr. Karzai, who has grown more anti-American in recent years despite having come to power with the help of the United States military, had been seen as a quiet opposition figure, albeit one intent on derailing Mr. Ghani\u2019s government.\n\nEven when he was in power, he was against the United States\u2019 use of air power on Afghan villages, but analysts say they believe the latest American bombing has given him another political pretext to mobilize against the government.\n\nMr. Karzai said he would mobilize opposition against the American presence in his country, \u201cfrom agitation, to protest, to going to the Afghan people.\u201d But it remains unclear how much influence he now has. The current Afghan authorities forcefully blame him for the corrupt institutions they inherited and are trying to peel away the layers of patronage that once made him a powerful player.\n\nWhile Mr. Ghani\u2019s coalition government has failed to make progress in many areas and has struggled to contain the Taliban as they have seized new territory, it has been able to withstand political pressure by opponents like Mr. Karzai.

After hearing the evidence ... the court is compelled to stay these executions.\"\nJohn Williams, an assistant federal public defender who represents some of the death row prisoners, called on \"state officials to accept the federal court's decision, cancel the frantic execution schedule, and propose a legal and humane method to carry out its executions.\"\n\"The unnecessarily compressed execution schedule using the risky drug midazolam denies prisoners their right to be free from the risk of torture,\" he said in a statement, referring to the drug used to render inmates unconscious before they are given two other drugs that paralyze and kill them.\nThe state's schedule of eight executions using midazolam between April 17 and 27 has been condemned by capital punishment opponents in the United States and abroad. Attorneys for the inmates said no state has attempted to conduct executions at the pace proposed by Arkansas in at least half a century.\nArkansas planned to execute the eight before its supply of lethal injection drugs expires at the end of the month.\nWhichever side loses the appeal will likely take the case before the US Supreme Court, according to Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law in Virginia. The latest appeal could conclude as soon as the coming week, he said.\nAnother judge blocks executions\nA state judge in Arkansas effectively stopped the executions Friday night, citing concerns over the lethal injection method.\nPulaski County Circuit Judge Wendell Griffen issued a temporary restraining order stopping the state from using the drug of vecuronium bromide for lethal injections.\nThe supplier of the drug, McKesson Medical-Surgical, argued the medication wasn't intended to be used for capital punishment. McKesson argued vecuronium bromide is for medical purposes, and that the Arkansas Department of Correction \"misled\" the company when it purchased the drug by phone, according to a court brief.\nMcKesson is asking the Department of Correction to return 10 vials of the drug.\nSaturday, McKesson filed a motion to have the restraining order lifted because of the federal judge's ruling.\nMcKesson said: \"The imminent danger that defendants (the state) would use McKesson's property and be unable to return it has been addressed by the federal court's preliminary injunction order. Consequently, there is no need for the temporary restraining order at this time.\"\nRutledge, the state attorney general, had filed an emergency petition to overturn the Griffen's order.\nTwo other drug companies, Fresenius Kabi USA and West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp., filed a brief in US District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas arguing contracts prohibit their products from being used in executions, which run \"counter to the manufacturers' mission to save and enhance patients' lives.\"\nControversial plan on executions\nTwo of the eight executions planned for this month already had been blocked in separate proceedings.\nA federal judge on April 6 blocked the execution of Jason McGehee. The Arkansas Parole Board had earlier voted to recommend that McGehee's death sentence be commuted to life without parole, and the judge ruled McGehee's April 27 execution date would not have given the board enough time, as required by law, to notify the governor of its recommendation.\nFriday, the Arkansas Supreme Court also blocked the execution of Bruce Ward.\nAttorneys argued that Ward, 60, should not be executed because he's mentally incompetent. He's been on death row since 1990 for strangling a woman in a convenience store bathroom, CNN affiliate KARK-TV in Little Rock reported.\nA report by a Harvard Law School initiative suggests six of the eight men Arkansas plans to execute by the end of April are not mentally fit for the death penalty, including Ward.\nAccording to the report, Ward told a forensic psychiatrist in 2010 that he hears voices, he gets revelations directly from God and he will \"walk out of prison to great riches and public acclaim.\" He said he's been visited in prison by his deceased father and \"resurrected dogs.\"\nIn March, Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced his controversial plan to execute eight inmates in a little more than a week, starting April 17.\nDefense attorneys argued that midazolam does not effectively keep those being executed from experiencing a painful death.\n\"If midazolam does not adequately anesthetize plaintiffs, or if their executions are 'botched,' they will suffer severe pain before they die,\" Baker wrote in her order Saturday.\nWard was one of two inmates set to die Monday.

There\u2019s widespread agreement that without the subsidies, insurers would be forced to hike premiums next year, worsening conditions in the Obamacare insurance marketplaces.\n\nThe president told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that not only would such a move cause Obamacare to \u201cdie,\u201d it could also be used to force Democrats to negotiate on repealing the health-care law altogether. \u201cWithout the payments, Obamacare is gone, just gone,\u201d Trump said.\n\n[Trump\u2019s threat prompts Democrats to play hardball over Obamacare payments]\n\nMany Republicans are well aware that the public is likely to blame them for premium increases, now that they control both Congress and the White House and have so far failed to agree on a health-care replacement plan. And Democrats are keenly aware of the shifting dynamics, seizing every opportunity they can to insist Republicans now own the health-care law.\n\nThe Democratic leadership in Congress says it will hold up the government funding bill that expires on April 28 in order to secure the payments if Trump decides to withhold them. But Republicans are unlikely to want to shut down the government \u2014 or for Trump to withhold the payments in the first place.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Democrats will let this happen, but I frankly don\u2019t think the Republicans want it to happen either,\u201d said Timothy Jost, a health-law professor at Washington and Lee University.\n\nRep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), who, as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, helped craft the GOP health-care plan, told constituents this week that the subsidies need to be funded, period.\n\n\u201cIt was a commitment made by the government to the insurers and the people,\u201d Walden said Wednesday at a town hall in his district. \u201cThat needs to happen.\u201d\n\nRep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), who chairs the powerful Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over health care, has also said it\u2019s important to fund the payments for insurers, although he stressed it\u2019s a decision that the House leadership would have to make.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the right thing to do, I think,\u201d Cole told The Washington Post last month. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019re going to have insurance companies exiting the market.\u201d\n\nOther top Republicans are remaining quiet about how to handle the subsidies, letting the White House lead the way. Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) isn\u2019t taking a position.

(Video: Peter Stevenson/Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\nThe Trump administration must decide whether it will continue pursuing a GOP lawsuit to block the subsidies. The House sued the Obama administration for awarding the subsidies without a clear congressional appropriation and won in federal court last year. The Obama administration appealed the decision.\n\nNow the GOP has the White House on its side \u2014 and a new concern that Republicans will bear the public blame for problems with Obamacare. Trump\u2019s victory created a tricky new situation that House Republicans surely didn\u2019t envision when they filed the lawsuit, said Bill Pierce, a \u00adhealth policy expert at APCO Worldwide.\n\n\u201cIt is a situation entirely of their own doing,\u201d Pierce said.\n\nRepublicans have said they were fighting the awarding of insurer payments without permission from Congress \u2014 not the subsidies themselves. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) hasn\u2019t said whether he wants to fund the subsidies in a spending bill later this month, and his office didn\u2019t respond Friday to a query about the issue.\n\n\u201cWe believe in Congress retaining its lawmaking power, but this lawsuit hasn\u2019t run its course,\u201d Ryan said late last month. \u201cWhile the lawsuit is running its course, the administration is exercising their discretion with respect to the [cost-sharing reductions].\u201d\n\nThe health-care law requires marketplace insurers to discount extra insurance costs beyond the monthly premium \u2014 such as deductibles and co-payments \u2014 for people earning less than 250 percent of the poverty level. Without federal payments to cover those discounts, it\u2019s estimated that insurers would hike premiums by an average of 19 percent.\n\nThat reality is leading law\u00admakers such as Walden and Cole to back the subsidies, even if they want to get rid of the underlying law. The cost-sharing reductions would cost an estimated $7 billion or $8 billion in the next year, but with that cost already built in, Congress wouldn\u2019t have to come up with extra money to fund them.\n\nIf Trump pushes for withholding the payments, it could fuel a clash between these lawmakers and conservatives who want to damage Obamacare in any way they can.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not alone in my party in [wanting to fund the cost-sharing reductions], but there are a lot in my party that don\u2019t think that,\u201d Walden said.\n\nInsurers are watching the situation with trepidation, with rapidly approaching deadlines for announcing whether they will continue selling plans on the insurance marketplaces next year. Kristine Grow, a spokeswoman for the trade association America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said more plans will likely exit without the cost-sharing reductions.\n\n\u201cA lot of plans are very likely to drop out of the market because of continued instability,\u201d Grow said.", "title": "Republicans may not want Trump to end Obamacare payments", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/republicans-may-not-want-trump-to-end-obamacare-payments/2017/04/14/f85409ea-214b-11e7-be2a-3a1fb24d4671_story.html", "id": 13, "media": "Washington Post", "datetime": "2017/04/14 00:00"}, {"author": "Yvonne Abraham", "content": "Is there no end to it?\n\nFifteen years after the clergy abuse scandal broke open, we are still confronted with shocking revelations of abuse in places that are supposed to nurture and protect our children.\n\nOn Thursday, Choate Rosemary Hall released a report on abuse at the elite Connecticut boarding school. It details a shameful history of predatory misconduct by a dozen former teachers between 1963 and 2010. It lays bare all of the ways in which abusers were enabled by the school, avoiding real accountability.\n\nThe Choate report goes into detail on the claims of two dozen victims. Unless you believe every abuser got caught on his first offense, many more surely suffered at their hands. It is such sickening reading, you have to wonder how parents could ever again entrust their children to this school \u2014 or any boarding school.\n\nFaced with allegations that teachers had kissed and groped students, and used their powerful positions to coerce teenagers into sex, the school chose to deal with the incidents quietly, or not at all.\n\nIn 1982, the parents of one student confronted the school about the fact that their daughter had contracted herpes from sex with an English teacher. The teacher was allowed to finish the school year, and went on to work at another prep school in Colorado. Another teacher remained at the school for 10 more years after a student said he had tried to kiss her in 2000. Recently, another student came forward to say this same teacher had coerced her into sex in the mid-1990s by threatening to give her bad grades and withhold college recommendations. A Spanish teacher was fired after allegedly groping a 15-year-old and sexually assaulting a 17-year-old, but the crime was not reported to the police. He was the principal of a high school in Litchfield until this month. Choate\u2019s repeated failure to act decisively and openly, and to follow mandatory reporting laws put other students at risk, both at the prep school and in the unlucky places where abusers landed after they left.\n\nHow did this happen? The same way it always has. Victims think they\u2019re the only ones, or that nobody will believe them. They\u2019re afraid to come forward. Their abusers are powerful and often popular. (In 1993, one victim said, he was shouted down at a Class of 1963 reunion when he described his abuse at the hands of John Joseph, a storied classics teacher for whom a building and scholarship had been named.) The institutions abusers work for want to avoid conflict, and bad publicity. They enlist students and faculty in attempts to keep abuse secret.\n\nAmazingly, the private schools seem to have learned little from the horrific abuses of children by Catholic clergy \u2014 who likewise traded on their positions of power, counted on their victims\u2019 shamed silence, and were protected by the church hierarchy. Only now have the many prep schools\u2019 victims emerged, after more relentless advocacy by their attorneys, and another Globe Spotlight investigation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same story over and over again,\u201d MacLeish says. \u201cThere is no decrease in the number of predators out there. Unless we come out of this really reflecting on what more we can do, and make it a permanent part of our culture, it will happen again.\u201d\n\nWhat more we can do: Zero tolerance for teachers and others who cross lines, immediate notification of authorities, protection for victims who come forward, consequences for leaders who fail to protect kids in their care.\n\nThe Choate report, depressing as it is, is the way forward. To its credit, the prep school has finally embraced its responsibility here. Rather than issuing some vague and euphemistic report, Choate has laid it all out in nauseating detail, finally risking the reputation for which so many victims were sacrificed over the decades.\n\nOnly daylight can protect others.", "title": "The Choate abuse case asks the question: Will we never learn?", "link": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/04/15/the-choate-abuse-case-asks-question-will-never-learn/vAPwYzUMXj5cibpmCzn2iI/story.html", "id": 14, "media": "Boston Globe", "datetime": "2017/04/15 22:37"}, {"author": "Kristine Phillips and Avi Selk", "content": "United Airlines will no longer allow crew members to displace passengers who are already seated on a plane.\n\nUnder a new policy, which is meant to avoid future public relations disasters like the one the world witnessed earlier this week, airline crews are required to check in at least an hour before a flight leaves, the airline company said.

Its total loss for all of 2016 was an equally impressive $2.8 billion.\n\nThose losses aren't connected to a giant failed merger, or closing down a business unit, or a collapse in the price of oil.

Even then, it reported only $45 million in losses from its day-to-day business operations, and by 1996 it would be regularly making $1 billion in quarterly profits.\n\nThe now-bankrupt telecommunications company Nortel lost over $20 billion in one quarter in 2001, in one of the defining moments of the dotcom crash. Even then, the company's loss from its operations was $1.6 billion, with the rest connected to one-off costs involving tens of thousands of layoffs and entire business units being abandoned.\n\nUber's closest relative, when it comes to losing giant amounts of money from its day-to-day business, is Amazon. Both companies have made huge losses even as the size of their business rapidly grows, and investors have celebrated each of them for it.\n\nBut even when compared to Amazon, Uber is a high-achiever in the losing-money business.\n\nAmazon's biggest ever annual loss was back in 2000, when it lost $1.4 billion. It didn't report an annual profit until 2003, and posted annual losses of $39 million in 2012 and $241 million in 2014. Its biggest-ever quarterly loss was in 2014, when it lost $437 million in the three months from July to September.\n\nAmazon has never come close to Uber-level losses.\n\nAnd even as Amazon posted these huge losses, it was a public company whose shareholders could freely buy and sell its stock. Uber's shares are not publicly traded, and the company doesn't have to convince the market that it knows what it's doing \u2014 it just has to convince future investors. So far, they seem more than willing to keep pouring money into the company, even with limited financial information.\n\nFor the time being, Uber investors have more to worry about than just its profit and loss statements. The company has experienced a never-ending public relations crisis this year, from allegations of systemic sexism to revelations of unsavory business practices and a blockbuster lawsuit that could slam the brakes on its self-driving car efforts.

The good part: If you're careful, they are totally avoidable.\n\nWhether you do your own return or use a preparer, there are certain items that always trip up taxpayers. Here are the most common mistakes, according to the IRS:\n\n\nShutterstock\n\n1. Missing or Inaccurate Social Security Numbers. Be sure to enter each SSN on a tax return exactly as printed on the Social Security card. A wrong Social Security number won't match up with the IRS system and it will result in a delay of your filing and return.\n\n2. Misspelled Names. Spell all names listed on a tax return exactly as listed on that individual\u2019s Social Security card. Note: My wife and I got tripped up on our joint return one year because her name wasn't in the IRS system as a hyphenated maiden-surname.\n\n3. Math Mistakes. They range from simple addition and subtraction to more complex items. Transactions like figuring the taxable portion of a pension, IRA distribution or Social Security benefits are more difficult and result in more errors.\n\nDouble check your math. Better yet, tax preparation software does it automatically, so file electronically.\n\n4. Errors in Figuring Tax Credits/Deductions of Filing Status Errors. Filers can make mistakes figuring their Earned Income Tax Credit, Child and Dependent Care Credit, the standard deduction and other items.\n\nFor example, if a taxpayer is age 65 or older, or blind, they should be sure to claim the correct, higher standard deduction. The IRS Interactive Tax Assistant can help determine if a taxpayer is eligible for tax credits or deductions (see below).\n\nYou should also check if you're single, or filing joint returns. Status matters a lot in determining your tax rates. Some people claim the wrong filing status, such as Head of Household instead of Single.\n\n5. Incorrect Bank Account Numbers. The IRS strongly urges all taxpayers who have a refund due to choose direct deposit. It\u2019s easy and convenient. Be careful to use the right routing and account numbers on the tax return. The fastest and safest way to get a refund is to combine e-file with direct deposit.\n\n6. Forms Not Signed. An unsigned tax return is like an unsigned check \u2013 it\u2019s not valid. Both spouses must sign a joint return.\n\nTaxpayers can avoid this error by filing their return electronically. Sign an e-filed tax return digitally before sending it to the IRS.\n\n7. PIN Errors. When e-filing, the taxpayer signs and validates the tax return electronically with a prior-year Self-Select Personal Identification Number (PIN).\n\nIf you do not have or know your PIN, you should enter your Adjusted Gross Income from your 2015 tax return originally filed with the IRS.

A New Jersey Transit spokeswoman said the train finally reached New York's Penn Station in the early evening.\n\nThe overcrowded train station erupted in panic when Amtrak police used a Taser to subdue a man who was causing a disturbance. New York police said the use of the Taser led to false rumors of gunshots at the station. People screamed and ran, leaving the station strewn with abandoned bags. The nearby Macy's department store was briefly locked down. Sixteen people suffered non-life-threatening injuries, police said.\n\nAmtrak said Friday night the subdued man, who wasn't a passenger from the disabled train, was in police custody.\n\nThe loss of power in the tunnel caused delays of an hour or more on Amtrak and New Jersey Transit. It happened three weeks after the derailment of an Amtrak train at Penn Station and a week after a New Jersey Transit derailment shut down eight of 21 tracks there and disrupted travel in the region for days. No injuries were reported in any of the incidents.\n\nOne passenger from Friday's train, Mia Sanati, described a scene of confusion.\n\nSanati said she and her husband were headed for the New York International Auto Show when they boarded the train in Secaucus, New Jersey, at Secaucus Junction, the last New York-bound stop before Penn Station.\n\nShe said shortly after the train entered the tunnel to go under the Hudson River, they felt a bump on the side of the train and saw sparks.\n\n\"About 30 seconds later, the train just came to a complete stop,\" Sanati said.\n\nThe power went out, except for emergency lights, and so did the air conditioning, said Sanati, who made video of the darkened car.\n\n\"It got really hot really fast, with that many people crammed together,\" she said.\n\nAs riders waited and plans changed -- they were told that the train would be towed, then that it would be evacuated -- some tried to make light of the situation or scooted over in their seats to make room for people who were standing. But others were shaking, pacing, saying they had to get out or mulling about walking through the tunnel, Sanati said.\n\nAfter the electricity came back on and the train started moving, there were cheers, said Sanati, who lives in Lyndhurst, New Jersey, and just finished a doctoral program in mass communications.\n\nRush hour passengers trying to leave New York faced mounting delays.\n\nAdam Rosen, a chemical engineer going to Hamilton, New Jersey, said, \"They keep extending the delays from 45 minutes to 90 minutes and now indefinitely. This is the worst.\"\n\nNew Jersey Transit executive director Steven Santoro said in a statement to affected riders, \"we deeply apologize for your experience, and I would like to hear from you.\"\n\nNJ Transit spokeswoman Nancy Snyder said the railroad was working with Amtrak to determine the cause of the problem.", "title": "NY-NJ train stuck in tunnel for 3 hours, then stun gun blast sparks stampede", "link": "http://www.syracuse.com/state/index.ssf/2017/04/ny-nj_train_stuck_in_tunnel_for_3_hours_then_stun_gun_blast_sparks_stampede.html", "id": 18, "media": "Syracuse", "datetime": "2017/04/15 13:09"}, {"author": "Dan Goodin", "content": "Contrary to what Ars and the rest of the world reported Friday, none of the published exploits stolen from the National Security Agency work against currently supported Microsoft products. This is according to a Microsoft blog post published late Friday night.\n\nFURTHER READING\nNSA-leaking Shadow Brokers just dumped its most damaging release yet\nThat's because the critical vulnerabilities for four exploits previously believed to be zerodays were patched in March, exactly one month before a group called Shadow Brokers published Friday's latest installment of weapons-grade attacks. Those updates\u2014which Microsoft indexes as MS17-010, CVE-2017-0146, and CVE-2017-\u2014make no mention of the person or group who reported the vulnerabilities to Microsoft. The lack of credit isn't unprecedented, but it's uncommon, and it's generating speculation that the reporters were tied to the NSA. In a vaguely worded statement issued Friday, Microsoft seemed to say it had had no contact with NSA officials concerning any of the exploits contained in Friday's leak.\nMicrosoft provided the following table showing when various vulnerabilities were patched:\n\nCode Name Solution\n\u201cEternalBlue\u201d Addressed by MS17-010\n\u201cEmeraldThread\u201d Addressed by MS10-061\n\u201cEternalChampion\u201d Addressed by CVE-2017-0146 & CVE-2017-0147\n\u201cErraticGopher\u201d Addressed prior to the release of Windows Vista\n\u201cEsikmoRoll\u201d Addressed by MS14-068\n\u201cEternalRomance\u201d Addressed by MS17-010\n\u201cEducatedScholar\u201d Addressed by MS09-050\n\u201cEternalSynergy\u201d Addressed by MS17-010\n\u201cEclipsedWing\u201d Addressed by MS08-067\nA measure of relief\n\nThe revelation that none of the highly advanced exploits work against supported Microsoft products brings a measure of relief to some of the more dire warnings sounded 24 hours earlier. It means that most home and small-office users are likely to be safe, since their systems are likely to have automatically installed the critical updates weeks ago. Computers in larger organizations, however, can often remain two or more months behind Microsoft's patch schedule, as administrators test the updates to ensure they're compatible with intranets and other internal systems. That means that some of the most sensitive and mission-critical networks may still be vulnerable to the four exploits, which are known as EternalBlue, EternalChampion, EternalSynergy, and EternalRomance.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s silence over unprecedented patch delay doesn\u2019t smell right\nSecurity researchers have taken to social media sites to speculate on the circumstances that led to Microsoft killing all four of would-be zerodays one month before they were published on the Internet. As mentioned above, one theory is that someone from the NSA privately gave Microsoft warning that the leaks were imminent. As reported Friday by Emptywheel, a Shadow Brokers release from early January gave NSA officials notice of some of the exploit names obtained by the mysterious person or group and later included in Friday's release. The extra time Microsoft needed to patch the bugs might possibly have something to do with February's unprecedented canceling of Patch Tuesday.\nA second possibility is that Microsoft paid Shadow Brokers for the vulnerabilities and didn't make that purchase public. In any event, and as noted by security commentator Ryan Naraine on Twitter, Microsoft's March Patch Tuesday bulletins explicitly said none of the Shadow affected vulnerabilities were being actively exploited, a claim company officials surely knew was false had the flaws been disclosed either by the NSA or the leakers.\n\n\nAnother plausible possibility is that Microsoft patched the vulnerabilities by chance and without advanced warning of the NSA. When the Shadow Brokers recognized that the exploits were no longer valuable zerodays, they published them in a campaign designed to sow confusion. That theory is consistent with Friday's release of other exploits that remained unpatched in unsupported Microsoft products including Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Exchange 2007, and IIS 6.0. Under this theory, none of the exploits published Friday worked on supported Microsoft products, so the Shadow Brokers decided to use them in a propaganda campaign. The problem with this theory, however, is the coincidental timing of the patch and leak seem highly unlikely.\n\nAside from the mystery surrounding the patching of these vulnerabilities one month ahead of the exploits, the other major question is how multiple security researchers and news outlets all incorrectly reported the exploits targeted fully updated products that remained supported by Microsoft. The answer is that researchers didn't test the exploits against fully updated versions of Windows 7 and other Supported Microsoft products.\n\nThe zeroday assessment \"was based on best information at the time and early testing, which turned out to be incorrect,\" the security commentator and researcher who goes by the moniker SwiftOnSecurity wrote on Twitter. \"Because there was no indication Microsoft patched these bugs, researcher systems did not include last month's patches, so they [the exploits] still worked.\"\n\nOther researchers, including Kevin Beaumont and Matthew Hickey, said they made the same critical mistake. Ars and dozens of other publications then reported those mistaken findings.

The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus was selected for the top spot.\n\nNext week the S8 and S8 Plus arrive into the hands of buyers.\n\nSamsung just revealed the new Galaxy S8 while all the rest of the major announcements have been completed over the past two months.\n\nReports from Samsung indicate it has already pre-sold more than 728,000 units with a target of 1 million prior to the 21 April launch date.\n\nI previously posted eight reasons the Galaxy S8 is good for business. As a supplement to that list, here are 10 reasons to consider the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus instead of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus, which was selected in the second spot of my 10 best smartphones.\n\n1. Display: The Galaxy S8 Plus has a 6.2 inch display with no side bezels and small top and bottom bezels. It is also narrower than the Apple iPhone 7 Plus that has a 5.5 inch display. Independent testing also shows the Galaxy S8 has the highest rated display of all smartphones.\n\n2. Fast charging and wireless charging: Actual battery life testing remains to be conducted for the Galaxy S8. However, if you do need to top off, it only takes a few minutes via USB Type-C or a wireless dock. It's a bit frustrating to charge up an iPhone 7 Plus, which explains why there is such a large market for slap on battery packs.\n\n3. microSD expansion: The iPhone 7 Plus has three memory configurations available with the largest capacity 256GB being more than enough for most people. The Galaxy S8 Plus offers 64GB internal with a microSD storage card slot so you can pop inexpensive storage cards in and out as you please.\n\n4. Gorilla Glass 5: Apple has glass on the front and metal on the back while the Galaxy S8 has glass on the front and back. However, this glass is Gorilla Glass 5 that is designed for increased drop protection over previous glass panels, surviving 1.6 meter, shoulder height drops.\n\n5. Multiple security options: With the Galaxy S8, you can set it up to unlock via facial recognition, iris scanning, fingerprint, pattern, PIN, or a password. The iPhone 7 Plus has a fast fingerprint scanner with options for a password or PIN, but Samsung's iris scanner may be a more convenient and secure option.\n\n6. Samsung DeX: People use their smartphones for everything today and with Samsung DeX, users now have the option to leave the laptop behind. I'll be testing this exact capability on two upcoming business trips. Apple has no ability to extend the iPhone to an external display.\n\n7. Virtual reality: Samsung continues to improve its virtual reality experience with a handheld controller now included with the Gear VR. While VR can be used for games or media viewing, there are also enterprise reasons for VR. These include presenting virtual walk-throughs of engineering designs, medical procedure reviews, and interactive presentations.\n\n8. Bixby: There is a ton of potential in Samsung Bixby as it looks to improve the efficiency and productivity of the user. Unfortunately, Bixby's voice assistant won't be ready at launch so we will only get a glimpse of the Bixby service with a home screen panel similar to Google Now. With a dedicated button on the Galaxy S8, Samsung is committed to making Bixby all it promises to be and I look forward to making regular tasks more convenient and intuitive.\n\n9. Bluetooth 5.0: You may not have seen or heard that the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus will be the first phones to launch with Bluetooth 5.0 support. Bluetooth 5.0 improves the connectivity performance, extends the range of Bluetooth, and allows you to connect two Bluetooth headphones to one Galaxy S8 at the same time.\n\n10. Samsung Pay: Apple Pay is popular, but nothing beats Samsung Pay when it comes to the number of retail locations that are supported and the technology that allows you to replace your credit or debit card. I made a couple of purchases with my Gear S3 smartwatch using Samsung Pay at a location that stated it did not accept wireless payments. More banks are added regularly and Samsung also offers a ton of promotions to encourage Samsung Pay use.\n\n11. Headphone jack: While Apple thinks it was courageous to take away the headphone jack, most people still use headphones with a standard 3.5mm connector. Samsung's purchase of Harman last year, buyers receive a nice pair of wired headphones in the box. While I appreciate and use Bluetooth headphones quite often, a 3.5mm headphone jack is convenient and economical while not having to worry about charging up another device.\n\nIt's clear that Samsung continues to push smartphone technology forward and Apple is looking a bit dated with the iPhone 7. However, Apple still offers a compelling experience as well and not all of Samsung's ideas and technologies are vital to the daily usage needs of all users.\n\nStay tuned for a full review of the Samsung Galaxy S8, S8 Plus, and accessories.", "title": "11 reasons why Samsung's Galaxy S8 is better than Apple's iPhone 7 for business", "link": "http://www.zdnet.com/article/11-reasons-the-samsung-galaxy-s8-is-better-than-the-apple-iphone-for-business/", "id": 20, "media": "ZDNet", "datetime": "2017/04/15 15:06"}, {"author": "Corbin Davenport", "content": "Motorola has been one leaky ship recently.

The phone hasn't changed much design-wise, presumably to keep full compatibility with existing Moto Mods. However, this device is slightly thinner (5.99mm) than last year's Moto Z Force (7mm).\n\nThe most interesting change is the headphone jack - last year's Moto Z and Z Force didn't have one.

The multiplayer-only game felt sparse at its $60 launch price, but it slowly evolved over four post-release map packs, each priced at $15. A full year after its release, Battlefront finally felt complete.\n\nSEE ALSO: These 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' poster spoofs are hilarious\n\nUnfortunately for players that stuck around, the economics of post-release downloadable content (DLC) created a problem. As time went on and fewer returned for the new content drops, a shrinking number of people had access to absolutely everything. That, in turn, made it more difficult to find matches or even play with friends who hadn't kept on top of add-ons.\n\nWhile the details of Star Wars: Battlefront II's post-release life remain vague, we can  confirm one major change: the Season Pass \u2014 which amounts to a discounted DLC pre-purchase \u2014 is no more.\n\nBernd Diemer, DICE's Battlefront II creative director, confirmed it outright in a chat ahead of the game's Star Wars Celebration 2017 reveal: \"We don't have a season pass.\"\n\nNow, that could just mean you won't be able to pre-purchase $15 map packs this time around. But Diemer's explanation suggests a more significant change.\n\n\"We decided on that, and it's one of those difficult decisions because it has so many implications all around,\" he continued. \"When we looked at the way Battlefront had evolved over its lifetime, with the DLC and everything, we decided, 'You know what? For this type of game, season passes are not the best thing. We need to [take it apart] and come up with something better.\"\n\nIt's clear that this decision was rooted in a core idea: \"We don't want to segment our community,\" Diemer said.\n\n\"I cannot talk about the specifics of this, but we have something different in mind that will allow you to play longer, be [more] invested in the game without having a fragmented community.\"\n\nDiemer admitted that it's \"dangerous\" to the health of a game's community when new maps and new modes are locked behind a paywall. It creates a situation where, as he put it, \"the community is falling apart because there are simply not many people playing the different modes.\"\n\n\"So we definitely want to avoid that.\"\n\nOne day after our interview, EA reached out to ask us to withhold the confirmation that there won't be a Season Pass for Battlefront II. The reason, we were told, is because they couldn't definitively say whether that would be the case, despite what Diemer said and expounded upon.\n\nIt sounds like they weren't ready to reveal this information yet, likely because the makeup of the Season Pass replacement hasn't been nailed down. \n\nEA sent over the following statement to attempt to clarify Diemer's remarks:\n\nWhile we\u2019re not ready to confirm any live service plans just yet, what we can say is this we heard the feedback from our Battlefront community loud and clear. We know they want more depth, more progression, and more content. So we\u2019re focused on delivering that in every dimension of Star Wars Battlefront II.

Fallon delivered no lines, a reference to Kushner's apparent aversion to public speaking. Alec Baldwin, playing President Trump, held a reality-TV-style elimination ceremony in which he chose Kushner over chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, depicted as the grim reaper.\n\nIt was a pretty tame sketch that continues a pattern of Fallon handling Trump with care. He took a little heat during the presidential campaign for going easy on Trump (most memorably when he tousled the billionaire's hair) but Fallon was in good company \u2014 and on top of the late-night ratings. As I observed last spring, ABC's Jimmy Kimmel also had \u201cmostly stuck to surface-level gags\u201d about Trump. For the bulk of the race, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d was pretty gentle, too, even inviting Trump to host the show during the Republican primary season.\n\n\nIn February, however, Kimmel hosted an Academy Awards show laced with political commentary, including his own.\n\n\u201cI want to say thank you to President Trump,\u201d he said during his opening monologue. \u201cI mean, remember last year when it seemed like the Oscars were racist?\u201d\n\nSince Baldwin began impersonating Trump during the final weeks of the election, \u201cSNL\u201d has developed a sharp edge and seemed to deliberately push the president's buttons by casting women as male members of his team.\n\n[Donald Trump didn't like that Sean Spicer was played by a woman on 'Saturday Night Live.' Don't act surprised.]\n\nWhat's more, Trump-bashing Stephen Colbert has started outdrawing Fallon on a consistent basis, since Inauguration Day.\n\nMelissa McCarthy returned to \u201cSNL\u201d as Sean Spicer this weekend, skewering the White House press secretary for claiming earlier in the week that Adolf Hitler refrained from using chemical weapons during World War II, even though he used poison gas to kill millions of Jews and others in concentration camps \u2014 or \u201cconcentration clubs,\u201d as McCarthy-as-Spicer called them. In real life, Spicer referred to \u201cHolocaust centers\u201d during a press briefing.\n\n\nMcCarthy's performance was far more provocative than anything Fallon did.\n\nFallon, who generally shies away from political commentary, is now an anomaly. His neutrality \u2014 theoretically an ideal quality for a broadcast network trying to appeal to a broad audience \u2014 is not reaping the ratings rewards it once did.\n\n\n5-Minute Fix newsletter\nKeeping up with politics is easy now.\nSign up\nRecall that Fallon made an \u201cSNL\u201d cameo in October, in which he made light of the perception that he is friendly with Trump. He dressed in drag to play a white female voter from suburban Philadelphia named Doreen Troilo and was joined by Tina Fey, who played Troilo's friend, Denise McDonough. Fallon-as-Troilo claimed to be undecided about whom to vote for, which led to this exchange:\n\nMcDONOUGH: Whatever. You love Trump.\n\nTROILO: I don't love Trump.\n\nMcDONOUGH: Yeah? Well, stop acting like you do. Everyone thinks you love Trump. You're always like ...\n\n(McDONOUGH PRETENDS TO TOUSLE TROILO'S HAIR)\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nTROILO: I did it one time. Get off my bra strap, cool police. I don't like Trump. I don't like that he called Alicia Machado fat.\n\nThe implication was that Fallon was speaking for himself, not merely for his character.

With the show\u2019s therapist, with a local therapist. I have met with and spoken to several LGBT organizations \u2014 I\u2019ve joined the board of a couple of them\u2026 this has changed me drastically.\u201d\n\n\nAs tough as it\u2019s been for him, Varner recognizes that Smith, 29, is the real victim here.\n\n\u201cThis is about Zeke,\u201d Varner said. \u201cI can only profusely apologize. I have apologized to him \u2014 we\u2019ve spoken several times on the phone. He continually forgives me. I am amazed and moved at his ability to do that. I know that forgiveness is difficult. I know that he has a lot of people in his ear. I know that watching this last night was traumatic not only for me and my family \u2014 I can only imagine what this was like for him and his friends and everybody who loves him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hurt him,\u201d Varner continued. \u201cWhen we were in pain and we are in fair, we are dangerous people. We say things we don\u2019t mean. And he\u2019s calling me a bigot and full of hate and all kinds of stuff. I forgive him for that. I give him every inch of every room to feel and experience what he\u2019s feeling. If he wants to take swings at me, I\u2019m the one to hand him the bat. I deserve it. I deserve every bit of it.

What\u2019s great is that nobody bought it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important people see he lost that fight,\u201d he added. \u201cThe message should be clear that hate will always lose.\u201d\n\nTo see Smith in the pages of PEOPLE, pick up the latest issue of the magazine, on newsstands now.\n\nHe also explained to PEOPLE that he did not want to be the \u201cfirst transgender Survivor contestant.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of being trans, but I didn\u2019t want that to be my story,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI just wanted to go out on an adventure and play a great game. I just wanted to be known for my game.\u201d\n\n\u201cI offer my deepest, most heart-felt apologies to Zeke Smith, his friends and life allies, his family and to all those who my mistake hurt and offended,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI recklessly revealed something I mistakenly believed everyone already knew. I was wrong and make no excuses for it. I own responsibility in what is the worst decision of my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me be clear, outing someone is assault,\u201d Varner said. \u201cIt robs a strong, courageous person of their power and protection and opens them up to discrimination and danger. It can leave scars that haunt for a lifetime. I am profoundly sorry. Zeke is a wonderful man and I will forever be amazed and inspired by his forgiveness and compassion. I thank God for that and the gift of being an example as to why you should never do what I did.\u201d\nIn an emotional interview with PEOPLE on Thursday, Varner broke down \u2014 saying his biggest regret was playing into the \u201cdeceitful\u201d stereotypes many have about transgender people.\n\n\n\u201cOne of the things that breaks my heart the most is that that\u2019s one of the stigmas that trans people fight the most,\u201d Varner said. \u201cPeople think trans people are out there deceiving and they\u2019re predators and they\u2019re hiding in bathrooms and stuff that\u2019s just not true. It\u2019s awful. We\u2019ve got to stop that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to stop discriminating and minimizing trans people.

Or in other terms, one point fewer than the total Johnson posted off the pine for Utah.\n\nMoving forward, the Clippers will need far more out of JJ Redick (seven points) and Jamal Crawford (eight points) if they want to solve Utah's stingy defense on a regular basis.  \n\nWith Game 1 in the books, the Clippers and Jazz will pivot toward Game 2\u2014which is scheduled for Tuesday evening at Staples Center (10:30 p.m. ET, TNT). \n\nUntil then, Gobert's status will be tracked closely after he was sent for an MRI in the second half of Game 1, according to the team's official Twitter account. \n\nAnd with the Clippers now headed back to the drawing board in anticipation of attacking a defense that could be without its fulcrum, head coach Doc Rivers figures to hone in on the middle of the floor and identify ways to exploit the Stifle Tower's absence. \n\nThe same will hold true for Snyder, who should continue to tinker with modified alignments that allow the Jazz to remain competitive even with Gobert banged up. \n\n ", "title": "JAZZ ESCAPE WITH GAME 1 WIN VS.

But the Cleveland Cavaliers have promises to keep. And miles to go before they sweep, and miles to go before they repeat.\n\nBesides the apologies offered up here to Robert Frost, it should be noted the connection between the Cavaliers\u2019 metaphoric miles and Indiana\u2019s C.J. Miles is merely coincidental. Then again, nothing would have driven home the point more about Cleveland\u2019s need to improve its play in an array of areas than if Miles\u2019 jump shot from the left wing had dropped through the rim with one second left, rather than bounding off as time ran out at Quicken Loans Arena Saturday afternoon.\n\nThat slim margin, had it flipped Cleveland\u2019s 109-108 victory into a one-point stunner at home in Game 1 of its first-round Eastern Conference series, would have brought 48 hours (at least) of drama, second-guessing and overwrought fretting about, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the Cavs?\u201d It\u2019s a question that\u2019s been in play for much of the past two months, one around which LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, coach Tyronn Lue and the rest of them tiptoed afterward.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long journey. We understand that,\u201d Irving said. \u201cWe don\u2019t take any possession for granted. Tonight, was just a lot of mistakes on our end. A lot of 50/50 balls that should have been in our hands. Fewer rebounds kicked out of bounds. Those are things we can correct. We just have to take it game by game. We understand that. We have a veteran group.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a group largely intact from the team that dug itself into, and then out of, a 3-1 hole in last June\u2019s Finals against Golden State. It\u2019s also the group that went 11-15 after the trade deadline, an ordinary 25-24 since Jan. 2, and played defense in a manner befitting the dregs of the league.\n\nThe Cavaliers have been alternating between denial and introspection for weeks. \u2018Fessing up in a given moment to how much better they need to be playing as the postseason competition gets dialed up, reassuring themselves if not others of their capacity to find and flip their playoff switch.\n\nThat duality was still in play Saturday. Cleveland surely was pleased with about shooting 54 percent against the Pacers, nearly 40 percent from 3-point range and the work its players put in at both ends during a 10-0 stretch in the third quarter that pushed its lead to a game-best 12 points.\n\n4:24Play\nCleveland was not so pleased that it frittered away that lead, despite Indiana star Paul George making just one bucket in the fourth quarter. Or that it managed just 17 points in that final period. Or that it fell behind 105-103 with 3:31 left ... at home ... against the East\u2019s No. 7 seed. The Cavs certainly had to flinch over Indiana\u2019s 11-of-24 shooting from the arc, along with the nearly fatal 13 free throws they missed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy we got the victory,\u201d James said after scoring 32 points and, with 13 assists, generating a bunch more \u2013 each one essential. \u201cI\u2019m happy how emotional we were. I\u2019m happy with the energy and the effort.\u201d\n\nSo much attention heading into this series had focused on the Cavaliers\u2019 readiness \u2013 could they flip the switch? \u2013 that you might have thought they were as simple as a kitchen appliance. Plug in the refrigerator, it runs, done.\n\nThe reality is that an NBA team, especially a title-worthy one, is more like the cockpit of a jet airliner. Switches, buttons, dials and levers galore. So while the Cavs may have found the emotional pitch they needed, they toggled from good to bad defensively. Irving, Kevin Love and J.R. Smith shot a combined 4-of-18 on 3-pointers and Kyle Korver\u2019s only field goal attempt was a two. Cleveland got outworked on the glass all game and out-hustled on the floor often enough that it stuck in Lue\u2019s craw.\n\n\u201cOverall defensively, we were pretty good, just outside of the loose balls that they got,\u201d Lue said. \u201cOffensive rebounds, put-backs. The 50/50 balls we didn\u2019t get to, they scored on. Y\u2019know, just clean those things up, it\u2019d be a different game. Eleven turnovers for 19 points and then missing 13 free throws wasn\u2019t good for us. We found a way to win the game, but we\u2019ll be better.\u201d\n\nLots of athletes and teams can live and take refuge in a binary world \u2013 who won, who lost? \u2013 but a defending champion that strays so from its peak performance is bound to get judged on style points. If the Cavaliers admit their play isn\u2019t where it needs to be, the teams hoping to unseat them \u2013 the Celtics, the Raptors, the Wizards and right now the Pacers \u2013 can\u2019t help but gain confidence.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that we believe it,\u201d Irving said, a little defensively. \"I\u2019ve never said that. I\u2019ve understand there are things that we can correct going forward. ... I don\u2019t know exactly what you\u2019re trying to ask. I don\u2019t know if I can answer it.\u201d\n\nAre the Cavaliers vulnerable?\n\n\u201cOh, if we feel vulnerable? Oh no. No,\u201d Cleveland\u2019s point guard said. \u201cNot going into any game, with the group that we have. I understand there are some mistakes that happen throughout the game. The regular season didn\u2019t end the way we want it to. But like I said, this is a step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nAnd still it came down to a make-or-miss by Miles, once James and Smith forced the ball from George\u2019s hands by double-teaming on the final possession. Imagine the wailing if that ball ...\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. There\u2019s no way you can really answer that question,\u201d James said, rejecting the hypothetical after running his streak of first-round victories to 18. \"If I didn\u2019t get the block [late in Game 7] last year in the Finals. If Kyrie didn\u2019t make the three. If Steph [Curry] would have made the three. There\u2019s so many ... you can\u2019t look at a game like that. He missed. We won.\u201d\n\nMiles to go, though.

Every few months, it dusts him off, winds him up and lets him do his thing\u2014which is something close to perfection\u2014and everyone claps politely and then proceeds to forget about him within a few minutes of his departure.\n\nAt least for one night, we may have hope that is about to change. In Kansas City, Missouri, Johnson was greeted like a star, performed like a star and walked off basking in the brightest spotlight his amazing reign has yet seen. \n\nPerhaps this is all it took: a near flawless, jaw-dropping kind of mastery that left him alongside one of the most legendary names in the sport and threatening to rise above him. Johnson's third-round submission win over Wilson Reis on Saturday marked his 10th straight UFC flyweight title defense, tying Anderson Silva for the most successful defenses in UFC history.\n\n\"[Georges St-Pierre] and Anderson Silva were great champions, but I'm the best champion to ever step foot in the Octagon,\" Johnson said in the cage moments after his win, per the UFC.\n\nThat claim is still debatable, but his case has plenty of evidence that is irrefutable, and more than that, it continues to build.\n\nWith one more win, Johnson will have done something that no one in the UFC has ever done. That is an argument with no counter.\n\nThe question between now and then will be which man gets the chance to end his streak. Will it be Joseph Benavidez, in a trilogy bout? Will Ray Borg get a shot? Or will the UFC try to set up Johnson's most high-profile match to date and grant bantamweight champ Cody Garbrandt's wish to face him?\n\nThe last of the three is the one Johnson is most deserving of, but it's also the matchup with the most hurdles. Johnson would have to be willing to wait until July just to set it up, all the while hoping that Garbrandt defeats T.J. Dillashaw in his first title defense.\n\nAnd oh, yeah: He'd require a seven-figure payday, something that has thus far eluded him in his career.\n\n\"The whole thing with Cody; I'm not worried about it,\" Johnson said in the post-fight press conference. \"I've never turned anybody down. I have nothing but love for the guy. He just won a belt. I've defended mine 10 times. If he comes down at 125, we welcome it. He doesn't dictate terms. Well maybe he does? I don't know, but at the end of the day, it is what it is. If Cody wants to come to 125, and UFC deems him ready for a title shot, perfect.\"\n\n\n\nIf Johnson comes off as indifferent to the prospective champion vs. champion fight, it's only because humility and modesty is a staple of his personality, as is his continued drive.\n\nAs Johnson's reign has unfolded, there has been a striking difference in his championship comportment as compared to either Silva or St-Pierre.\n\nLate in their reigns, both of those men openly discussed the crushing strain of wearing a target. Johnson has never shown any signs of being stressed by the many would-be usurpers circling him.\n\nStardom also has little meaning to him, which is why he has never altered his personality to fit the MMA superstar archetype. \n\n\"I'm not searching for that. That's not why I do this sport,\" he said. \"I'm not here to be prom king. I want to be the best fighter in the UFC. I think I proved that tonight, dominating a world-class grappler. I don't think I was touched on the feet.\"\n\n\nYes, Saturday's win was even more stunningly perfect than those that have come before it. According to FightMetric, Johnson limited Reis to landing just 10.6 percent of his strikes (18 of 170), a dismal ratio that amounted to quicksand for the challenger. It's already nearly impossible to beat Johnson, but when you are consistently swinging at air, it is hopeless. By the middle of the second round, Reis must have felt like a dog chasing his tail.\n\nAnd like all great champions, once Johnson had his opponent deflated, the fight's ending was a mere formality. Johnson nearly finished Reis in the second, dropping him with a knee to the body and then pouncing on his grounded opponent with a series of hammerfists, but Reis was able to survive the few seconds to the horn.\n\nReis wasn't so lucky in the third. Worn down and damaged, he was put down after Johnson pummeled him from the top and pivoted to an arm bar, making the first submission loss in Reis's 29-fight, decadelong career.\n\nWhen it was over, Reis just shrugged and hugged Johnson. There was nothing else to do. There was no way to spin things for a positive outlook.\n\nThere was just the stark bluntness of both the process and the result.\n\nAnd that, in the end, is the greatness of Johnson. Yes, his numbers are impressive. Yes, his skill set is sublime. But during this 10-fight stretch, he has mostly left opponents bewildered. \n\nHe has been so good for so long that in formulating the game plan against him, opposing coaches have to concede a few basic truths. If they are honest with themselves and their charges, they must admit in their preamble, \"I know you're going to miss strikes...\" \n\nWith that kind of statement, there is usually something afterward, some plan of action or attack. Some theoretical offense. But none of it ever comes to pass. \n\nAgainst Demetrious Johnson, it's a pipe dream, a mirage, a fantasy.\n\nMaybe we can all acknowledge him now. And maybe the UFC can give him his well-deserved payday. Whether it's Garbrandt or the co-main event spot of a Conor McGregor card, Johnson has earned this like no one in UFC history ever has.\n\nAt least on Saturday night, the fight world took notice. That's a start. Now as he flies back home and disappears from our view for a couple of months, let's not forget him.\n", "title": "FOR DEMETRIOUS JOHNSON, CHAMP VS.

If Jackson is going to stay here for two more years and finish off the kind of bad contract he generally awards to coaches and players, then Anthony is absolutely better off somewhere else. Including the moon.\n\nIt is ironic, when you think about it. So often when Jackson is talking about Anthony he sounds as if he is talking about himself. Starting with how stubborn he says Carmelo Anthony is. You\u2019ve got to admit. That\u2019s a good one.\n\nBut the one who ought to be somewhere else is Jackson himself.\n\nIt is worth pointing out again that if anybody else in town had his record as an executive, they would already be on their way out of town. His greatest success as an executive isn\u2019t drafting Porzingis, after everybody in the league knew how hard he\u2019d tried to peddle the fourth pick in that draft. It is taking James Dolan\u2019s money.\n\nYou wonder now if Irving Azoff, the manager of the Eagles who brokered the deal between Dolan and Jackson, still has the run of Madison Square Garden the way Jackson does. Maybe Dolan\u2019s long game is that if he sticks with Jackson long enough, he will eventually get the Knicks to the NBA Finals the way Glen Sather finally got the Rangers to the Stanley Cup final. Good luck with that.\n\nJackson\u2019s record with the Knicks now stands at 80-166. He says the fans see the Knicks getting better. But why wouldn\u2019t he think he can sell fans his particular brand of snake oil, as he looks around night after night and sees the Garden full of people who continue to support a team that has become one of the two biggest losers in the sport (along with the Timberwolves) over the last 15 years? Maybe these are the same people who still buy into the laughable notion that the Garden is still a \u201cmecca\u201d of basketball. Ask the question again, loudly, and even from the cheap seats, if you can still find any of those at the Garden:\n\nMecca of what, exactly?\n\nEither Dolan continues to be star-struck by the mere presence of Jackson in the building, or he is still desperate to use Jackson as cover for the biblical mess that the Knicks have become since Jeff Van Gundy walked away from Dolan and the Knicks in December of 2001. We hear constantly about how much Dolan wants to win. As he stays with Jackson after 80-166. And is told that the real plan over the past three years was getting to the next plan.\n\nScott Layden would never have survived a record like that. Donnie Walsh wouldn\u2019t have survived. Isiah Thomas survived his own various calamities, on and off the court, until Dolan finally kicked him to the curb. Glen Grunwald was the guy in charge when the Knicks won 54 games and the Atlantic Division, and he didn\u2019t make it to Opening Night the next season.\n\nJackson is three awful seasons working on four. At least Woody Johnson, no beacon of enlightened ownership, had seen enough of John Idzik after two seasons to get rid of Idzik. Now Jackson stands up on Friday and talks about how three years into his rebuilding program he\u2019s starting another rebuilding program. This is the part where it becomes official that Dolan\u2019s basketball emperor isn\u2019t wearing any clothes.\n\nJackson: \u201cI didn\u2019t come here just to particularly win a championship but to do things that were directed by my instructions by Dolan \u2014 let\u2019s have something that is identifiable in who we are and how we play.\u201d\n\nWell, they\u2019ve certainly done that, haven\u2019t they? In that moment, the Knicks moving further and further away from a championship wasn\u2019t just Carmelo\u2019s fault\u2026 it was actually Dolan\u2019s, too!\n\nBut if Jackson wasn\u2019t brought here to win a championship, then why did Dolan throw $60 million at him three years ago? Getting better? No, the Knicks are getting worse. And if you still believe this is somehow all Anthony\u2019s fault, then you also believe pigs can fly.\n\nAround nine months after Jackson began going through Dolan\u2019s wallet, the team built around Carmelo Anthony, the old ball holder who finished third in MVP voting that year, finished a season that saw them win 54 games and the Atlantic Division title and the only playoff series the new York Knicks have won since they made it to the Eastern Conference finals in 2000. Think about that. One playoff round won, 17 years. At the \u201cmecca\u201d of basketball. The Nets have won as many playoff series as the Knicks since they moved to Brooklyn. Maybe they should start calling the Barclays Center the mecca of basketball in New York.\n\nSomehow, through it all, Jackson continues to act as if he still exists on some higher basketball plane than everybody else. Somehow the guy who is clearly obsessed enough with the media that he essentially hid from them for an entire season acts as if his problems with Anthony were created by the media. No, he is the one who created those problems by giving the guy $120 million and a no-trade clause in his contract and then acting shocked that Anthony was the exact same player he\u2019d always been.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t win with him on the court,\u201d Jackson says.\n\nActually, the Knicks can\u2019t win with Jackson anywhere near the court at Madison Square Garden. He is the guy who gave Joakim Noah $72 million. He is the guy who thought that Derrick Rose could somehow thrive in a triangle offense that fit him about as well as a pair of basketball shoes about four sizes too small. He is the guy who has hired Derek Fisher (at $25 million), Kurt Rambis and Jeff Hornacek as his coaches.\n\nHe is playing Knicks fans for suckers. Doing the same with his boss. But he is the one not going anywhere. He\u2019s handed out some bad contracts since he got here. The worst is the one Dolan gave him. Carmelo would be better off somewhere else? No kidding? Look who\u2019s talking.\n\nHank on an island, Eli\u2019s helmets & Masters-ful finish . . .\n\n- Yeah, who wouldn\u2019t want the chumpwit who says he no longer dates hot women?\n\nIf you watched just the third period of Rangers-Canadiens Friday night, you know this the way you do your screen name:\n\nIt felt as if the Canadiens spent about a week in Henrik Lundqvist\u2019s lap.\n\nMike D\u2019Antoni will probably win Coach of the Year in the NBA.\n\nBrad Stevens of the Celtics is as good a basketball coach as there is anywhere, college or pros.\n\nBut raise a hand if you thought Quin Snyder\u2019s Jazz were going to win 51 games this season and be the fifth seed in the Western Conference.\n\n- You never want to get behind your own story, or your own news cycle, even though that\u2019s obviously happened with Eli Manning.\n\nBut it\u2019s hardly too late for him to explain what he meant with that email about two helmets that \u201ccould pass as game used.\u201d\n\nBy the way?\n\nEd Werder made a good point the other day on ESPN, when he asked how many helmets an NFL quarterback actually uses across the course of a season, and what these people think they\u2019re buying.\n\nSometimes \u2013 a lot of times \u2013 you get the idea that the whole sports memorabilia business in this country makes telemarketing seem like church.\n\nEventually we\u2019ll likely find out that this case with Eli might not rise to the level in Jersey of something as bad as \u2014 oh, I don\u2019t know \u2014 having your aides snarl traffic on the George Washington Bridge and those aides getting jail time as a result.\n\nSomething like that.\n\n- No Jordan Spieth in the mix on the back nine at Augusta last Sunday.\n\nNo Rory McIlroy.\n\nNo Dustin Johnson, who withdrew on Thursday after saying he fell on some wet steps.\n\nWith all that, Justin Rose and Sergio Garcia, a major champion and a guy desperate to finally become one, provided one of the great last two hours any Masters Sunday has ever seen.\n\nAnd it is worth remembering that after Rose seemed to have taken control of the final round after Sergio made bogeys at 10 and 11 starting the back nine and then seemed to have shot himself in the foot and out of things with that errant drive on No. 13, Sergio Garcia\u2019s ball-striking was almost flawless from 14 tee on.\n\nBirdie on 14.\n\nEagle on 15.\n\nKnocked it stiff on 16 even though he missed the putt.\n\nEven though he missed his first birdie putt on 18, before they played it again in sudden death, he hit a beautiful iron shot to give himself a chance.\n\nPlayed like a major champ, on the day when he finally became one.\n\nHad played 73 majors without winning.\n\nThen finally won one on the 73rd hole at Augusta.\n\nVery cool.\n\nThe Boston Red Sox miss David Ortiz even more than they thought they were going to, no matter how much young talent they have up and down their batting order.\n\n- It was nice to hear Phil Jackson, by the way, admit that there might have been a few holes in the Knicks\u2019 defense this season.\n\nWell, at least until \u2013 in the Zen Master\u2019s view \u2013 Ron Baker practically became Defensive Player of the Year in the last two weeks of the season.\n\nCNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria seems like one of the good guys, but if he gets any more defensive about saying that Trump became president because he hit Syria with those missiles the other night, he\u2019s going to show up on TV wearing a helmet.\n\n- I know what the Warriors\u2019 record was during the regular season when Kevin Durant was healthy.\n\nI know how they turned it on down the stretch, even before Durant came back.\n\nBut now we will see how he and Steph Curry make it work in the playoffs.\n\nClyde and Earl the Pearl did it a long time ago with the Knicks, after they went from being basketball adversaries to teammates.\n\nNow we see with Curry and Durant.\n\nOh, good, let\u2019s play a game of nuclear chicken with the little nut from North Korea.\n\nI honestly do believe that when they remove Steve Bannon from the White House, the scene is going to resemble the doctor getting removed from United 3411.", "title": "Phil Jackson is the one who should be getting told to leave Madison Square Garden and the Knicks", "link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/phil-jackson-run-msg-article-1.3060652", "id": 30, "media": "Daily News", "datetime": "2017/04/16 01:28"}, {"author": "Katrina Pascual", "content": "Ten nights of staunch observation may have led astronomers to successfully peer inside a black hole and take an image of its event horizon, or its point of no return.\n\nThe mass of data collected is now on its way to two supercomputers in the United States and Germany to confirm in early 2018 if it is indeed the very first capture of the renowned gravitational sinkhole.\n\nBlack Hole Information Paradox\nThe ultimate goal for researchers was getting a picture of a region surrounding the black hole. This is the event horizon, or the boundary beyond which not even light can escape the object\u2019s massive grasp.\n\nAlbert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, born in 1915 and which details how gravity affects the cosmos, has the existence of extremely massive black holes as one of its first predictions.\n\n\u201cThey are the ultimate endpoint of space and time, and may represent the ultimate limit of our knowledge,\u201d said radio astronomer Heino Falcke of Radboud University in the Netherlands, adding that the first images will turn black holes from mythical things to concrete evidence that scientists can actually study.\n\nEinstein\u2019s theory notes that all the information crossing a black hole\u2019s event horizon gets lost forever. Yet according to quantum mechanics, information can never be lost.\n\nBack in the 1970s, astrophysicist Stephen Hawking found that black holes can disappear, and so information can be lost forever. The theoretical structure that quantum mechanics puts forward is therefore compromised if the particles\u2019 information could indeed be lost in the black hole.\n\nEvent Horizon Telescope\nAll the scientific inquiry and ambition has led to the widely ambitious Event Horizon Telescope, an international collaboration linking eight observatories to create a virtual telescope dish as wide as Earth. While the method is nothing new, it is the first time that a project is done on a large scale.\n\nThe radio-dish network went to work on a 10-day window starting April 4, peering at two supermassive black holes: Sagittarius A*, lying at the core of the Milky Way and 4 million times as huge as our sun; and the Messier 87, a black hole in a neighboring galaxy some 53 million light-years away.\n\nThe telescope has investigated the vicinity of each of the monster black holes before, but this marks the first time the network comprised the South Pole telescope as well as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) telescope located in Chile.\n\nALMA, for one, increases the Event Horizon Telescope\u2019s acuity 10 times, allowing it to find something as tiny as a golf-sized object on the moon \u2014 and potentially the small event horizons of the black holes.\n\nHurdling The Weather And Months Of Waiting\nThe image returned is hoped to demonstrate the flow of material moving in and out of the black hole.\n\n\u201cWhat we expect to see is an asymmetric image where you have a circular dark region. That\u2019s the black hole shadow,\u201d MIT research scientist Vincent Fish told Newsweek, adding the presence of the photon ring or a spherical area of space where gravity is so potent that photons are forced to travel in orbits.\n\nThe weather proved to be a crucial factor in the mission as astronomers observe black holes in millimeter radio waves, which water absorbs as well as emits. This means precipitation could cloud the observations.\n\nMitigating this issue involves placing radio telescopes at high altitudes, although rain, clouds, or snow could still take the observatory offline. Even high-altitude winds could shut down a given telescope.\n\nThus Fish and his fellow scientists met every day to decide on when to activate the large network and assess weather conditions at every site. Constant weather monitoring and communication among astronomers were done.\n\nThe researchers have collected about one petabyte of data, which equates to MP3 songs playing continuously for more than 2,000 years without any repeats. Two research institutes, the MIT Haystack and the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Germany, are receiving the said data.\n\nThe telescopes\u2019 recorded information is stored on 1,024 drives, which will be mailed to the research institutes\u2019 processing centers. Hard drives coming from the South Pole telescope, too, cannot be sent out until the end of winter in the region, or by the end of October.\n\nDespite the long wait and other external factors, the team remains optimistic. Falcke said that even if the images emerge as \u201ccrappy and washed out,\u201d they can help test basic predictions of Einstein\u2019s theory in the extreme-physics environment of a black hole.\n\nKnowing the black hole\u2019s mass and distance, explained Fish, means one should see the shadow and ring, and that the latter will have a specific diameter and will be quite circular.\n\n\u201cIf the shape isn\u2019t circular or the wrong size, then relativity has made a prediction that has failed,\u201d he said.", "title": "Earth-Sized Telescope Just Took The First-Ever Photo Of A Black Hole: How It Will Test Theory Of Relativity", "link": "http://www.techtimes.com/articles/204891/20170415/earth-sized-telescope-just-took-the-first-ever-photo-of-a-black-hole-how-it-will-test-theory-of-relativity.htm", "id": 31, "media": "Tech Times", "datetime": "2017/04/15 22:37"}, {"author": "Marcia Dunn", "content": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) \u2014 A tiny, ice-encrusted ocean world orbiting Saturn is now a hotter-than-ever candidate for potential life.\n\nNASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft has detected hydrogen molecules in the geysers shooting off the moon Enceladus, possibly the result of deep-sea chemical reactions between water and rock that could spark microbial life, scientists announced Thursday.\n\nNASA and others are quick to point out this latest discovery does not mean there\u2019s life on Enceladus (ehn-SEHL\u2019-uh-duhs), but that there may be conditions favorable for life.\n\nA liquid ocean exists beneath the icy surface of Enceladus, which is barely 300 miles (500 kilometers) across. Scientists have long known about the plumes of water vapor spewing from cracks at the moon\u2019s south pole, thanks to Cassini . The heavy presence of hydrogen suggests chemical reactions between the warm water and ocean-floor rock that could support life.\n\nCassini uncovered the hydrogen during its final close flyby of Enceladus in 2015, when it dove deeper than ever through its plumes of vapor and particles. The researchers reported that the hydrogen, along with carbon dioxide that was also found, could mean that undersea microbes are producing methane as they do in the bowels of our own oceans and waterways.\n\n\u201cIt really represents a capstone finding for the mission,\u201d said Cassini\u2019s project scientist, Linda Spilker, noting that the spacecraft has been circling Saturn for more than a decade.\n\n\u201cWe now know that Enceladus has almost all of the ingredients that you would need to support life as we know it on Earth,\u201d she said at a NASA news conference.\n\nA press conference viewer, asking questions of the scientists via Twitter, asked if NASA was talking about bacteria or algae \u2014 or giant squids.\n\n\u201cMost of us would be excited with any life,\u201d said Mary Voytek, an astrobiology senior scientist for NASA. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start with bacteria and, if we get lucky, maybe there\u2019s something that\u2019s larger.\u201d\n\nThe findings were reported Thursday in the journal Science by a team from Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio.\n\nLaunched in 1997 and now finally running low on fuel, Cassini is drawing ever closer to its demise. The spacecraft will duck through the gap between Saturn and its rings 22 times before spiraling out of control and vaporizing in the sky above Saturn this September.\n\nCassini has no instruments that can detect life, so it will be up to future robotic visitors to seek out possible life on Enceladus, the scientists said.\n\nEuropa, an ice-covered moon of Jupiter also believed to have a subsurface ocean, may have water vapor jets spewing into space as well, similar to Enceladus. The Hubble Space Telescope has observed what looks to be plumes emanating from Europa. A spacecraft under development called the Europa Clipper, to launch sometime in the 2020s, could shed more light on the matter.\n\nVoytek said her money is still on Europa for potential life, versus Enceladus, since Europa is much older and any potential life there has had more time to emerge.\n\nWhile questions remain, Thursday\u2019s news represents \u201can important advance in assessing the habitability of Enceladus,\u201d Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\u2019s Jeffrey Seewald wrote in a companion article.\n\n\u201cWe still have a long way to go in our understanding,\u201d said Seewald, who was not involved in the study. \u201cFuture missions to explore oceans beyond Earth will answer many of these questions.\u201d", "title": "Ocean world near Saturn top contender for life beyond Earth", "link": "http://krqe.com/2017/04/15/ocean-world-near-saturn-top-contender-for-life-beyond-earth/", "id": 32, "media": "KRQE", "datetime": "2017/04/15 19:23"}, {"author": "RT", "content": "Scientists have created a device that can literally extract water from the air using solar power which could one day provide \u201cpersonalized water\u201d to those in areas affected by chronic drought.\nResearchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the University of California Berkeley published their findings in the journal Science on Thursday.\n\nThe invention can harvest water from the atmosphere in conditions where relative humidity is as low as 20 percent, which makes it potentially usable in many of the planet's driest regions.\n\nREAD MORE: Somalia drought crisis: 110 people dead from hunger in 2 days, says PM\n\nWith an estimated 1 in 10 people lacking access to clean drinking water and 4 billion people worldwide facing severe water shortages the potential for this technology is huge.\n\n\u201cThis is a major breakthrough in the long-standing challenge of harvesting water from the air at low humidity,\u201dsaid Omar Yaghi from Berkeley, who along with colleague Evelyn Wang from MIT created the revolutionary tech.\n\n\u201cThere is no other way to do that right now, except by using extra energy. Your electric dehumidifier at home \u2018produces\u2019 very expensive water,\u201d he added.\n\nWang echoed these statements; \u201cThis work offers a new way to harvest water from air that does not require high relative humidity conditions and is much more energy efficient than other existing technologies,\u201d the mechanical engineer said.\n\nIn order to harvest water, the system uses a specially designed material, a metal organic framework (MOF) designed by Yaghi over 20 years ago. By combining metals like magnesium or aluminium with organic molecules the MOF creates rigid, porous structures ideal for storing liquids and gases.\n\nEssentially the system absorbs and traps air in nanometer sized pores. When sunlight is added, water molecules inside the trapped air get released and condensed into drinkable H2O. Using just 2.2 pounds (997g) of MOF the device can harvest 2.8 litres of water over a 12 hour period.\n\n\u201cOne vision for the future is to have water off-grid, where you have a device at home running on ambient solar for delivering water that satisfies the needs of a household,\u201d Yaghi told Berkeley news.\n\n\u201cTo me, that will be made possible because of this experiment.

Large swathes of the reef - the world's largest living marine structure - were ghastly white and bore the distinct marks of coral bleaching.\n\nProfessor Terry Hughes, a marine scientist at James Cook University in Queensland who led the survey, later said in a tweet that it was \"without doubt the most confronting research project I've ever done\".\n\nAfter weeks of aerial and underwater surveys, the study findings were released last Monday: Two-thirds of the 2,300km stretch of the Great Barrier Reef had suffered serious bleaching, mainly due to warming water temperatures.\n\nIt marked the first time scientists have observed consecutive years of mass bleaching events on the reef.\n\nSaving the reef\nQ What is coral bleaching?\n\nA Rising water temperatures are the main cause of bleaching, according to scientists. The heat stress causes the algae that live in the coral's tissue to leave. This deprives the coral of its major food source and can leave it white or pale. If the algae loss is prolonged, the coral eventually dies.\n\nClimate Council, a non-governmental organisation in Australia, said \"extreme coral bleaching and the death of reefs will become the new normal unless serious and rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are achieved\".\n\nQ What can help revitalise the reef?\n\nA If the temperature cools and the algae return, the coral can recover, but it may take years or decades. Scientists say urgent action is needed to combat climate change in Australia and around the world.\n\nEfforts to address overfishing and pollution can also help.\n\nThere have been four severe bleachings in recent times: in 1998, 2002, 2016 and 2017.\n\nScientists said the duration of the current bleaching means it will be much harder for the coral to recover. It is a development that threatens a lucrative tourism sector that attracts 2.8 million visitors a year and earns an estimated A$7 billion (S$7.4 billion) annually.\n\n\"It takes at least a decade for a full recovery of even the fastest-growing corals, so mass bleaching events 12 months apart offers zero prospect of recovery for reefs that were damaged in 2016,\" said Dr James Kerry, from James Cook University, in a statement last Monday.\n\nAccording to the survey, the worst of the bleaching was in the middle third of the reef. Only the bottom third was unscathed.\n\nSea surface temperatures in the Great Barrier Reef last year were the hottest since records began in 1900. Other causes of damage include cyclones, overfishing and pollution.\n\n\"Clearly the reef is struggling with multiple impacts,\" said Prof Hughes. \"Ultimately, we need to cut carbon emissions, and the window to do so is rapidly closing.\"\n\nThe bleaching has removed some of the allure from the famed stretch of colourful reefs.

The surge, which includes 221 cases this year, constitutes the highest incidence of mumps in the state in 22 years.\n\nMumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus that spreads from person to person through saliva and mucus.\n\"What we've seen -- as in other parts of the country, (it's) really just the same thing -- a pretty big resurgence in mumps cases over the last six or eight months,\" said Chris Van Deusen, spokesman for the state's health services department. In 2016, Texas experienced 192 mumps cases, he said, primarily in the last few months of the year.\nHow vaccines stop diseases like measles\n\nHow vaccines stop diseases like measles 01:26\nMumps typically begins with fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness and loss of appetite lasting a few days, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most people will have swelling of the salivary glands, causing puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw. Generally, symptoms last at least two days but no more than 10 days.\nBecause it is caused by a virus, mumps does not respond to antibiotics. Doctors generally recommend bed rest and over-the-counter pain relievers.\n\"We have largely seen outbreaks in North Texas, so the Dallas-Fort Worth area and some of the surrounding counties,\" Van Deusen said, adding that Dallas County has experienced two or three significant outbreaks.\n\"We've had quite a large one with, counting last year and this year, more than 150 cases in Johnson County, which is just south of Fort Worth,\" he said. \"We've certainly seen cases in other areas of the state, but those have been where the largest outbreaks have been centered.\"\nAn outbreak in Johnson County, in particular, included 189 cases spanning last year and this year among children and a couple of college students, he said.\n\"There have been people who have traveled back and forth between (Johnson County) and Northwest Arkansas, where they've been seeing much of the activity, so it seems to be linked to that outbreak,\" Van Deusen said.\nAn outbreak of mumps began in Arkansas in August, explained Dr. Dirk Haselow, Arkansas' state epidemiologist. Between August and April 13, Arkansas reported 2,930 cases, he said. (Similarly, Washington state (PDF) has been hard hit by the mumps, reporting 611 confirmed and probable cases during 2017.)\n\"We've had less than 500 cases this year,\" said Haselow, who believes his state is at the tail end of its outbreak. \"Thankfully, the number of cases we've had each week decreased recently. We've only added 14 cases in the last three weeks.\" At the height of the outbreak, nearly 50 cases a day were reported across 35 counties. Today, only four counties are experiencing infections.\nAs for a possible spread from his state to Texas, Haselow has no doubts.\n\"Mumps has a long incubation period, as long as 26 days between exposure and symptoms, so people could have been exposed, you know, a little over a month ago, and now you have new cases with that association,\" he said.\nAcross the nation, most mumps cases are occurring among people who have been vaccinated, according to the CDC, and these outbreaks are not due to low vaccination rates. For example, in Texas, 97.6% of kindergarten-age children have received two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, Van Deusen said, while 98.7% of seventh-graders have.\nThe CDC recommends that children get two doses of the MMR vaccine. One dose is considered about 78% effective initially (PDF), and two doses are about 88% effective. So even if you are vaccinated, you need to practice primary prevention.\n\"Obviously, one of the things you do is avoid people with mumps,\" said Infectious disease specialist Dr. William Schaffner, but he noted that this practice is limited in its ability to ward off the mumps for two reasons.\n\"People can actually spread the mumps virus for several days before they become sick,\" he said. The second reason: Mumps also causes subclinical infections.\n\n\"That is, I can get infected, but I don't get sick. Still, I'm capable of passing it on to someone else,\" Schaffner said. \"That's a big problem.\"\nMumps can cause complications, especially in adults. These include deafness and inflammation of the brain, ovaries, breast tissue or testicles. Occasionally, mumps can cause encephalitis, which in rare cases can lead to death, says the CDC.\nThere's a safe way to prevent complications, Schaffner says: the MMR vaccine.\n\"We say that the vaccine, after 15 years, is about 85% effective,\" he said. So the bad news is that 15% of people who have been vaccinated are likely to become ill if they encounter mumps very closely.\n\"However, the good news is, the complications of mumps seem not to develop,\" Schaffner said. People who have been vaccinated are unlikely to get meningitis or inflammation of the ovaries or testes, or partial deafness. \"It would appear these complications are not occurring among these individuals who have partial immunity. They get a milder infection.\"\nJoin the conversation\nSee the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThose who favor pre-emptive strikes might consider an updated vaccine, he said.\n\"Should everyone traveling to Texas get another dose of MMR? We're not there yet,\" Schaffner said, adding that the CDC is not recommending such measures.\nStill, if you're visiting family in Texas and know that they have the mumps, you might go to your doctor beforehand and request a dose of MMR, he suggested.\n\"You may have to pay for it out of pocket,\" he said. \"How much protection it gives me, I don't know, but it is a safe and easy thing to do.\"\nEach year, the number of mumps cases fluctuates within a range of a couple hundred to a couple thousand cases, according to the CDC. In 2016, 5,311 cases were reported in 46 states and the District of Columbia.\n", "title": "Texas warns about biggest mumps outbreak in 22 years", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/14/health/mumps-texas/", "id": 36, "media": "CNN", "datetime": "2017/04/14 18:07"}, {"author": "Beth Dalbey", "content": "Diners at two local restaurants in Ann Arbor, Michigan, may have been exposed to measles on April 6-7, according to state and local public health officials, who announced Friday that a second case of measles had been reported in Michigan. Both the recent case and one last month involved adults who are not related, but both were on the same international flight, health officials said.\n\nThe second individual with measles was at a customer at Mark\u2019s Midtown Coney Island, 3586 Plymouth Road, between noon and 3 p.m. on Thursday, April 6, and at Benny\u2019s Family Dining, 1952 S. Industrial from noon-3 p.m. on Friday, April 7, the Washtenaw County Health Department said. Anyone who was at the two restaurants should monitor themselves for rash, fever or other symptoms of the highly communicable disease for the next 21 days. Anyone who suspects measles should seek medical treatment.\n\nThe health department said the issue is not one of food safety or restaurant sanitation. Both restaurants are working with Washtenaw County health officials to help notify employees and members of the public about the potential exposure.\n\nMichigan\u2019s first 2017 case of measles was reported on March 30 in Oakland County.\n\n\u201cThis underscores the importance of routine vaccination for both children and adults, and of making certain as many Michiganders as possible have protective immunity against measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases,\u201d Dr. Eden Wells, chief medical executive for Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said in a news release. \u201cMeasles is highly contagious, and though it is generally a rare disease in the United States \u2013 in fact it was eliminated from the country in 2000 \u2013 it shows up every year as a result of travel to other parts of the world where it continues to be a common illness.\u201d\n\nMeasles is a vaccine-preventable respiratory infection that can result in hospitalization, pneumonia, encephalitis and death. Measles can also cause miscarriages or premature delivery in pregnant women. Droplets from the nose or mouth, through sneezing, coughing or speaking, spread measles. A person with measles is contagious for four days before and four days after the rash appears.\n\nSymptoms initially include a high fever, red eyes, cough, runny nose, and eye discomfort or sensitivity in the yes, and is followed by a red, raised body rash starting on the head and face that progresses to the rest of the body.\n\nIndividuals may be contagious for a few days before they present with symptoms, which increases the potential of exposing others to the infection.\n\nBecause measles is highly communicable, vaccination is the best line of defense, and successful prevention and control requires high levels of immunity in all communities, Wells said.\n\nGet free real-time news alerts from the Detroit Patch.\n\nThe state health department is coordinating with local health departments in southeast Michigan to monitor any potential secondary cases in individuals who may have been exposed to the initial case. Individuals known to have been potentially exposed while the patient was receiving treatment are being contacted for follow up.\n\nLast year, Michigan confirmed one case of measles. From 2001 \u2013 2012, the average number of measles cases reported nationally per year was about 60. But in recent years there have been more, a cause of concern among public health authorities. In 2014, there were 667 cases nationwide, including five cases in Michigan.\n\nThe majority of people who got measles were not vaccinated, Wells said.\n\n\u201cThe measles vaccine is highly effective and very safe,\u201d she said. \u201cAdults who do not have evidence of immunity against measles should get at least one dose of the vaccine.\u201d\n\nMeasles is part of the vaccination regimen recommended for children. The first of two doses is given at 12 months, but children who are traveling internationally should receive their first measles vaccine as young as 6 months, according to the release.\n\nThe vaccination, or documentation of immunity to measles, is recommended for all persons travelling internationally, Wells said.\n\nThe state health department recently joined the Fanny Strong Foundation to launch the public awareness \u201cI Vaccinate\u201d campaign as part of an effort to educate parents about serious vaccine-preventable diseases.", "title": "Diners At 2 Ann Arbor Restaurants Exposed To Measles", "link": "https://patch.com/michigan/detroit/diners-2-michigan-restaurants-exposed-measles", "id": 37, "media": "Patch", "datetime": "2017/04/15 11:12"}, {"author": "Omar Burgess", "content": "With reports by the Center for Disease Control showing the number of heroin-related overdose deaths quadrupling between 2002 and 2013, drug treatment centers are looking to alternative methods that get around a recent congressional ban on federally funded syringe exchange programs.

But it will help set the tone for Britain\u2019s contentious talks to split from the bloc, where the 27 remaining leaders of the bloc have taken a hard line against any major concessions on key issues such as trade.\n\nIf May emerges strengthened from the elections \u2014 as opinion polls currently suggest at the moment \u2014 she will have greater clout to muzzle domestic dissent as she buckles down for talks. But if anti-Brexit voices do well in the polls, May could be forced to soften her demands from Europe.\n\nNo matter how the vote swings, the six-week election campaign is certain to reopen some of the bitterness of last year\u2019s referendum as voters are once again asked to consider what kind of country they envision after its E.U. break and in generations to come.\n\n\u201cI have concluded the only way to guarantee certainty and stability for the years ahead is to hold this election and seek your support for the decisions I have to make,\u201d said May, who last month submitted Britain\u2019s formal request to begin E.U. exit negotiations.\n\nFrom her first day in office, May\u2019s tenure has been shaped by the fallout from Brexit. She became prime minister in July, shortly after the referendum that set in motion Britain\u2019s E.U. split and prompted the resignation of her predecessor, David Cameron.\n\n[Britain\u2019s snap elections won\u2019t reverse Brexit]\n\nPart of the election call by May is to seek her own political mandate and shrug off the image as Cameron\u2019s replacement after he bet wrong on the Brexit referendum.\n\nMay has consolidated power within the Conservative party. But the lack of her own popular mandate had threatened to become a liability as Britain begins to reckon with the inevitable trade-offs that come with the tricky Brexit talks.\n\nIn the election announcement, May argued that her political opponents \u2014 ranging from the independence-minded Scots to pro-E. U. factions in Parliament \u2014 are undermining Britain\u2019s negotiating position with the European Union. At the same time, some hard-liners in her own Conservative Party are baying for a so-called \u201cdirty Brexit\u201d that could see Britain walk away from the negotiating table without any deals with European Union.\n\n\u201cThe country is coming together, but Westminster is not,\u201d she said, referring to Parliament.\n\nBut it is not clear that the nation is coming together on Brexit \u2014 the wounds are still festering, and the election threatens to reopen it all again.\n\nBut May is sensing political opportunity.\n\nHer Conservative Party has a very narrow majority and the opposition Labour Party is struggling in the polls. If she can strengthen the majority of the Conservative Party, she will have a freer hand to face down both pro-E. U. opponents and anti-Europe firebrands in her own party.\n\nStill, May is taking something of a calculated political gambit with elections set for just two weeks before the anniversary of the Brexit referendum.\n\n[The Brexit road map]\n\nPolls show that the Conservative Party has strong lead over the opposition Labour Party of more than 20 points. But the announcement still caught some off guard because Downing Street had repeatedly denied that May would seek an early election. The next one was scheduled for 2020.\n\nMay has repeatedly insisted she would not seek an early election, saying that the country needs to focus its attention on negotiating the terms of Brexit with its soon-to-be-former European partners, not domestic politics.\n\nBut the temptation to call a new vote was strong, and allies had been pushing for her to break her vow, as the gambit may not be of such high risk due to weakness in the rival parties.\n\nThe Labour Party has been at war with itself since the election of the far-left Jeremy Corbyn as leader in September 2015. A recent poll showed that, in a head-to-head matchup between May and Corbyn, not even a majority of Labour votes would want Corbyn as their prime minister.\n\nCorbyn, however, welcomed the decision as a chance to \u201cgive the British people the chance to vote for a government that will put the interests of the majority first.\u201d\n\nOther parties are similarly weakened. The far-right U.K. Independence Party has lost its charismatic leader, Nigel Farage, and its central message \u2014 that Britain needs to get out of the E.U. \u2014 has been co-opted by May. The centrist Liberal Democrats were all-but-wiped out in the 2015 election, though they will hope to rally the Brexit referendum\u2019s \u201cremain\u201d voters around their unapologetically pro-European stance.\n\nMay planned to seek Parliament backing on Wednesday for the June 8 elections.\n\n[In \u201cBrexit capital,\u201d Labour\u2019s struggles on display]\n\n\u201cWe need a general election, and we need one now,\u201d May said, \u201cbecause we have at this moment a one-off chance to get this done while the European Union agrees its negotiating position and before the detailed talks begin.\u201d\n\nShe said that she \u201crecently and reluctantly\u201d decided to call early elections, acknowledging that she has repeatedly said that there should be no general election until 2020.\n\nBut she said that it was the only way to guarantee stability and to stop the \u201cgame-playing\u201d in Westminster. She cited several examples of what she called \u201cdivision\u201d in Westminster, including the Labour Party, which she noted has threatened to vote against the final deal negotiated with the European Union.\n\nTim Farron, the leader of the pro-European Liberal Democrat Party, said the election call offered an opportunity to urge May to take a more conciliatory line in the E.U. talks.\n\nSome critics worry that Britain could lose important trade status and other links to Europe by pushing for what May called a full-break from Britain. There are also concerns for over the estimated 3 million E.U. citizens working and living Britain, and more than 1 million Britons across Europe. May said she would seek to preserve their rights, but some E.U. officials have suggested they will take a hard line with Britain in the talks.\n\n\u201cIf you want to avoid a disastrous \u2018hard Brexit.\u2019 If you want to keep Britain in the single market. If you want a Britain that is open, tolerant and united, this is your chance. Only the Liberal Democrats can prevent a Conservative majority,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe E.U. bureaucracy, however, has shown little sympathy for giving Britain as easy landing from Brexit \u2014 still stinging over Britain\u2019s vote and worried that generous concessions in Brexit could encourage other E.U. breakaway bids around Europe.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk, a powerful voice in the Brexit talks, summed up the surprise many in Europe felt at May\u2019s announcement. \u201cIt was Hitchcock who directed Brexit: first an earthquake and the tension rises,\u201d Tusk wrote on Twitter.\n\nAlthough Britain as a whole voted 52 to 48 percent in favor of leaving of the European Union, majorities in both Scotland and Northern Ireland favored staying in the E.U.\n\nScottish leader Nicola Sturgeon has charged that Scottish voters are being taken out of the bloc against their will, and she said last week that she wants a referendum on independence \u2014 a rerun of a September 2014 vote, in which a majority of Scottish voters opted to stay in the United Kingdom \u2014 between the autumn of 2018 and the spring of 2019.\n\nMay has sharply criticized that call. She said over the weekend that \u201cnow is not the time\u201d for a Scottish vote. But she has not threatened to veto another referendum.\n\nMoments after the election call, Sturgeon described it as an attempt by May to move the Conservative Party to the right and \u201cforce through a hard Brexit and impose deeper cuts.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s stand up for Scotland,\u201d she wrote.\n\nMurphy reported from Washington.

Archer Macy said at a 2015 talk on missile defense the Defense Department was trying to develop technologies to prevent missiles from launching, mess with their flight paths or navigation systems and even destroy their warheads.\n\"We cannot afford to build enough interceptors to engage the quantity of threat missiles which can be presented to us. And even if we could, we can never expect a 100% probability of defeating all of them regardless of the techniques used,\" Macy said.\n\nAs far as what to hack, \"there's lots of ways in, which makes it very hard for the defender to know what's being attacked and what's not being attacked,\" said Austin, who is leading the UNSW's newly-announced Research Group on Cyber War and Peace.\nMost missiles have a self-destruct button, which could be activated.\nSomething like the Stuxnet virus, which penetrated Iran's Natanz nuclear facility, could be deployed.\nIn theory, it could be as simple as infecting systems with corrupted software via a USB thumb drive, says Jai Galliott, a defense analyst and professor at UNSW. Though the question remains how that could physically be done in a country as closed-off as North Korea.\nAustin believes a successful hack would most likely target the launch sequencing, which could potentially degrade the launch.\n\"All you'd have to do in a complex missile launch system is like the (Stuxnet virus in the) Iranian nuclear enrichment facility. Just interfere with a process that creates a physical effect of some sort that then has a destructive effect on the operation of the missile.\"\n\nThe most sophisticated cyberweapon ever deployed 09:36\nThat's not to say hacking the missile system is easy -- it would likely require plenty of money and manpower. Pyongyang goes to great lengths to hide its military technology from the rest of the world.\nMost advanced missiles also have an air-gap built in -- a way to keep the technology disconnected from the outside world -- says Galliott, though some research shows they can be hacked using other methods.\nMeasuring its efficacy would be difficult, too. A lot can go wrong in a missile launch and it may not always be clear if a launch fails due to meddling or an error on the North Korean side.\nConsidered a pre-emptive strike?\nThe technology also raises thorny questions. Some might argue deploying this sort of offensive technology is tantamount to a pre-emptive military strike -- something North Korea says it would respond to militarily.\nIts detractors worry the technology could degrade trust between nuclear-armed states -- notably China, Russia and the US -- and alter the balance of already-fragile relationships.\n\"It will likely never be possible to know whether nuclear weapons systems have been breached and compromised or whether they will work as planned when needed,\" says Andrew Futter, a lecturer of international politics at the University of Leicester.\nFutter says it will be difficult to convince nations like China and Russia that the US won't use the technology to their detriment.\nWashington has had a hard enough time trying to convince Moscow and Beijing that THAAD, a US-built missile defense system being placed in South Korea, will only be used for its stated purpose against North Korea.\nAnd there are benefits to having it as a deterrent.\n\"The upside of Chinese or Russia concern over the integrity of their ballistic missiles is obvious; they could become less likely to engage in risk behaviors if they don't know their own missiles will work,\" Robert Farley, a senior lecturer at the Patterson School of Diplomacy and International Commerce, wrote in The Diplomat.\n\"The downside is that a sudden sense of vulnerability has the potential to make anyone -- Moscow, Beijing, or Pyongyang -- paranoid and unpredictable.\"", "title": "Could the US take out North Korea's missiles before launch?", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/18/asia/cyber-missile-defense-north-korea/", "id": 40, "media": "CNN", "datetime": "2017/04/18 10:26"}, {"author": "Robert Costa", "content": "CHAMBLEE, Ga. \u2014 Republicans had hoped Tuesday\u2019s special election in Georgia\u2019s wealthy and sleepy 6th Congressional District would be just like every other House race here since 1978: the mostly painless elevation of a rock-ribbed and polished conservative.\n\nThose hopes have died.

Embed  Share Play Video2:09\nJon Ossoff, a former congressional aide, is running for the seat of former Republican congressman Tom Price in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District. Here\u2019s what you need to know about him. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\nTrump \u2014 who barely won this district last year and tweeted Monday that the media coverage of the race was a \u201cgame\u201d and \u201cBAD!\u201d \u2014 is eager to stave off a Republican stumble that could become an ominous bellwether of his standing as he attempts to build support in the coming weeks for the big-ticket legislative items that have eluded him in the GOP-controlled Congress during the early months of his presidency.\n\n[Two Republican lawmakers face anger, from their own voters, on health care]\n\nIf Ossoff places first or second with support in the mid-40 percent range among the 18 total candidates \u2014 surveys show that scenario as most likely \u2014 he will face a tougher matchup this summer, when many of the warring Republicans would almost certainly coalesce to save the seat.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s election law initially piles candidates of all stripes onto a single ballot. If no one wins a majority, the two top finishers move on to a head-to-head contest months later.\n\n\u201cHaving 11 people on our side is like eating our young,\u201d Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), a friend of Trump, said in an interview Monday. He compared the infighting to the \u201cnightmare\u201d of his own 2014 statewide primary and added: \u201cYou risk letting the Democrat slide through without a runoff. But I don\u2019t think that will happen if we get the turnout.\u201d\n\nDemocratic congressional leaders and liberals from around the country have rallied for Ossoff as Republicans have clawed at one another, contributing millions to his insurgent bid and watching him soar to the top of several polls \u2014 and salivating at the prospect of picking up a seat that hasn\u2019t gone blue since Georgia\u2019s own Jimmy Carter occupied the Oval Office.\n\nTrump has become a complicated figure in establishment Republican enclaves such as Chamblee, which boasts a tony shopping center with a gourmet doughnut shop and a sleek Mexican restaurant whose patio is packed in the evenings with 30-something couples. Passing through the leafy neighborhood on a warm Monday afternoon, one sees a slew of navy-blue Ossoff signs dotting sidewalks and apartment windows.\n\n Democratic candidate Jon Ossoffis ahead in many polls in a special election for Georgia's 6th Congressional District. With 11 Republicans competing in Tuesday\u2019s contest, a splintered GOP is struggling to hold onto the traditionally Republican seat, which was vacated by Tom Price, President Trump\u2019s secretary of health and human services. (Kevin Liles/Reuters)\nRepublicans\u2019 failure to pass their plan to overhaul the nation\u2019s health-care system has sown doubts among some suburban GOP voters about Trump\u2019s effectiveness in cutting deals with lawmakers in Washington, as well as the party\u2019s promises. The health-care episode has particular resonance in this district since Price, a physician, was its representative from 2005 until February, when he joined the Cabinet.\n\nCole said the National Republican Congressional Committee, which he formerly chaired, has dispatched staffers to Georgia to stoke turnout among core GOP voters amid those grumbles. The Congressional Leadership Fund, an outfit aligned with the House GOP, has spent more than $2 million on a spate of negative television spots about Ossoff.\n\n[This cowboy-poet is trying to steal a Republican House seat in Montana]\n\nAt the White House, an official said, the president is paying close attention and has been briefed by aides about the race. Political director Bill Stepien is working with the state party and the congressional committees. Chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon is involved in discussions about how to encourage Republican turnout.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s pugilism and lack of a cohesive conservative worldview on fiscal and foreign policy have confounded Republicans here. Previous holders of the seat have included a mainstream, business-friendly Republican, Sen. Johnny Isakson, and a stridently ideological conservative, former House speaker Newt Gingrich.\n\n.\u2009.\u2009.The district is \u201ca little bit of an oddity,\u201d said Ralph Reed, a conservative leader and longtime strategist in both Georgia and national Republican circles. \u201cJust in its socioeconomic profile, it doesn\u2019t really lay out as Trump country. It\u2019s highly educated, upscale, suburban, and Trump country tends to be more rural to exurban, more high school or only some college.\u201d\n\nThe way the Republican contenders are handling Trump and the concurrent rise of populism and moderate angst in the wake of his victory is revealing, even though the names of the near-dozen candidates are unfamiliar. Everyone seems to be laboring, with varying success, to figure out a pitch that pulls together the fractured GOP ranks.\n\nInteractions with Trump\u2019s political brand have veered from hearty embrace (Dan Moody, Bob Gray, Bruce LeVell, Amy Kremer) to support but not always rah-rah (Karen Handel, Judson Hill) to flat-out defiance (David Abroms). Most of the leading candidates have bounced between those poles depending on the day or the latest controversy.\n\nHandel, a favorite of antiabortion activists who has the highest name recognition and once served as Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, said in an interview Monday that she is concentrating on doing her \u201clevel best to represent the interests of the 6th District\u201d in her positions rather than linking arms with Trump.\n\n\u201cObviously I\u2019m a Republican and support the president,\u201d Handel said. \u201cBut being in Congress is not the same as being an extension of the White House. I\u2019m more than willing to step up and speak out when the circumstances demand that. .\u2009.\u2009. People want a doer \u2014 someone they trust who can move our party from vocal opposition to governing.\u201d\n\nEndorsements from prominent Republican players have been scattered to the point of muddying the field. Perdue has backed Moody. Gingrich supports Hill, as does Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.). Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski endorsed LeVell. Former senator Saxby Chambliss is for Handel. But the conservative Club for Growth has opposed Handel and boosted Gray. To counter the club, the Ending Spending advocacy group, which is backed by the billionaire Ricketts family, has poured millions behind Handel\u2019s candidacy.\n\nIt goes on and on like that further down the line in the state. One group or officeholder goes for Handel, another goes for Gray, another jumps in for Moody or Hill, and Trump supporters of different degrees poke and prod one another on social media.\n\nUnsurprisingly, no one has caught fire, and constant squabbling has remained the thrust of the GOP race. As Ossoff\u2019s candidacy has exploded on the left \u2014 landing on the cover of New York magazine, raising more than $8 million, and attracting the support of actors such as Samuel L. Jackson and bloggers at \u00adMoveOn.org and Daily Kos \u2014 the Republicans have hovered below 20 percent in most polls.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a shot at an upset,\u201d Rep. Charlie Crist (D-Fla.) said. \u201cIt\u2019s like what we\u2019re seeing all around, this backlash. The protests, the marches. Democrats want to make a statement.\u201d\n\nAs they did in a special House election last week in Kansas, where Republicans narrowly won a seat that has long been safely GOP, Democrats see, if not a chance at victory, at least a chance to rattle Trump and Republicans as they look toward 2018 and the possibility of winning back the chamber. The surge in early voting here has only raised expectations that Ossoff could hit 50 percent Tuesday or do well in a runoff, which would be held June 20 if needed.\n\nTrump signaled in a tweet Monday how Republicans would define Ossoff in a runoff election: \u201cThe super Liberal Democrat in the Georgia Congressioal [sic] race tomorrow wants to protect criminals, allow illegal immigration and raise taxes!\u201d\n\nOssoff replied in a statement: \u201cWhile I\u2019m glad the president is interested in the race, he is misinformed.\u201d\nAn Emerson College survey released late last week showed Ossoff with 43 percent. Handel garnered 17 percent, Gray \u2014 a former local councilman and businessman \u2014 15 percent and Moody \u2014 a former state senator \u2014 9 percent. Hill, another former state senator, was at 6 percent.\n\nLeVell, an African American jeweler and former Trump campaign adviser, as well as Trump-aligned conservative activist Kremer, have struggled, perhaps showing the difficulty of being a die-hard Trump supporter in a Republican district that\u2019s not dominated by grass-roots nationalism. Abroms, who has campaigned with anti-Trump independent Evan McMullin, has also found it hard to get on the political map.\n\nPerdue, who has worked closely with the Trump White House, said he is confident that despite the bloodletting among Republicans, a runoff election would end favorably since this \u201cdistrict is a traditionally 60-40 Republican district, and we really don\u2019t want to give a vote to Nancy Pelosi,\u201d the House Democratic leader.\n\nBut Perdue acknowledged that his party is still figuring things out. \u201cIt\u2019s a democracy,\u201d he said wryly of the clashing Republicans. One upside to the fracas, he volunteered, is that \u201cour candidates are not coached like the Democrats.\u201d", "title": "Georgia House race stokes GOP identity crisis \u2014 and opportunity for Democrats", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/georgia-house-race-stokes-gop-identity-crisis--and-opportunity-for-democrats/2017/04/18/a2231a48-242f-11e7-b503-9d616bd5a305_story.html", "id": 41, "media": "Washington Post", "datetime": "2017/04/18 08:16"}, {"author": "Yonhap", "content": "The overcharging of foreigners by taxi drivers in the Seoul metropolitan area appears to be tapering off, the municipal government said Tuesday, citing the results of its continued crackdowns.\n\nAccording to the Seoul Metropolitan Government, the average taxi fare paid by foreign visitors for trips from Incheon International Airport, west of Seoul, to hotels in the capital city fell from 84,600 won ($75) in the August 2015-July 2016 period to 68,800 won in the August 2016-March 2017 period.\n\nUsually, a taxi ride from Incheon's airport to Seoul's hotels averages 55,000 won.\n\n\nThis undated photo provided by the Seoul Metropolitan Government shows a crackdown on a taxi fare scam under way at a Seoul hotel.

In one of the crackdown methods, civil servants seek to interview foreign passengers getting out of taxis or vans at the entrances of major hotels, it noted.\n\nUnder the current rules, a taxi driver is fined 200,000 won for the first overcharging offense.

All charts will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, April 18.\n\n\n\nAs it continues atop the Hot 100, Sheeran's \"Shape,\" released on Atlantic Records, becomes one of only 18 No. 1s (of 1,061 total leaders) to have topped the chart for at least 12 weeks, dating to the list's Aug. 4, 1958, inception. It's the first since The Chainsmokers' \"Closer\" (featuring Halsey), which reigned for 12 weeks between September and November 2016.\n\n\"Shape\" adds a 10th week at No. 1 on Radio Songs and, impressively, is still gaining, up 3 percent to 185 million in airplay audience in the week ending April 16, according to Nielsen Music. It's the first song to hit double-digit weeks at No. 1 on the chart since, again, \"Closer\" (11 weeks, beginning in October).\n\n\"Shape\" holds at No. 2 on Streaming Songs (41.5 million U.S. streams, down 4 percent, in the week ending April 13) and No. 3 on Digital Song Sales (66,000 downloads sold, down 13 percent, in the week ending April 13). It led the lists for four and 10 weeks, respectively.\n\nBruno Mars' \"That's What I Like\" rebounds from No. 3 back to its No. 2 Hot 100 high (for a fourth total week in the runner-up spot). It stays at No. 2 on both Radio Songs (151 million, up 8 percent) and Digital Song Sales (73,000, down 5 percent). It dips 3-6 on Streaming Songs, but gains by 6 percent to 34.6 million. \"Like\" leads the Hot R&B Songs chart for a ninth week and rebounds 2-1 for a fourth week atop Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.\n\nAfter debuting a week ago at No. 2 on the Hot 100, Kendrick Lamar's \"Humble.\" drops to No. 3.

The track tops the Hot Rap Songs chart for a second week. It introduces Lamar's LP DAMN., released Friday (April 14) and due on next week's Billboard 200 albums chart.\n\n\n\nStyles' \"Sign of the Times\" launches at No. 4 on the Hot 100, with the One Direction member's solo debut arriving at No. 1 on Digital Song Sales (142,000).

The boy band has scored six Hot 100 top 10s, charting highest with \"Best Song Ever,\" which reached No. 2 in 2013. In February 2016, following his exit from the group, Zayn became the first 1D member (past or present) to chart solo on the Hot 100, rocketing in at No. 1 with \"Pillowtalk\" (with 267,000 in first-week sales). The act's Louis Tomlinson reached No. 52 in December with his first Hot 100 entry, \"Just Hold On\" (with Steve Aoki), and Niall Horan rose to No. 20 in January with his solo debut, \"This Town.\"\n\nFurther reflecting the anticipation that has accompanied One Direction solo projects, the group is the first in the Hot 100's history to have two of its members earn top 10 debuts. Along with Styles' \"Sign\" and Zayn's \"Pillowtalk,\" the latter also launched at No. 6 in December with \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever (Fifty Shades Darker)\" (with Taylor Swift). Meanwhile, 1D has tallied five top 10 debuts, the most among groups; boy band forefathers The Beatles rank second with four.\n\n\"Sign\" previews Styles' self-titled first solo album, due May 12 on Columbia Records. He performed the single, as well as the LP's \"Ever Since New York,\" on NBC's Saturday Night Live over the weekend.\n\nRounding out the Hot 100's top five, The Chainsmokers and Coldplay's \"Something Just Like This\" is steady at No.  5, after reaching No. 3.

Powered by the #MaskOffChallenge meme, in which everyone from dancers to violinists and flute players have shown off their talents in clips accompanying the song, the track jumps 7-3 on Streaming Songs (36.7 million, up 52 percent) and 17-15 on Digital Song Sales (35,000, up 7 percent), while growing by 25 percent to 24 million in airplay audience.\n\nFuture had previously hit the Hot 100's top 10 in 2013 as a featured artist, with Drake, on Lil Wayne's No. 9-peaking \"Love Me.\" \"Mask Off\" is from Future's self-titled album, which debuted atop the Billboard 200 dated March 11; when his HNDRXX arrived at No. 1 the following week, the rapper became the first artist in the chart's history to debut on top in consecutive weeks.\n\nLike Future's \"Mask Off,\" Lil Uzi Vert's \"XO TOUR Llif3\" bounds to the Hot 100's top 10 (16-8) fueled by viral buzz, specifically the #LilUziVertChallenge, which is based on a shoulder-shimmy dance performed by the rapper, and has prompted fan-made videos across several social media platforms. The cut holds at No. 5 on Streaming Songs, up by a robust 21 percent to 32.9 million, and climbs 45-36 on Digital Song Sales (18,000, up 10 percent). Lil Uzi Vert vaults to his second Hot 100 top 10 and first as a lead; he spent three weeks at No. 1 in January-February as featured on Migos' \"Bad and Boujee.\"\n\nSam Hunt's \"Body Like a Back Road\" pulls into reverse, backing up to No. 9 on the Hot 100 after reaching No. 6 last week. The track holds at No. 4 on Digital Song Sales (61,000, down 12 percent); it had surged by 19 percent in the prior tracking week after Hunt performed it at the Academy of Country Music Awards April 2. Still, it rises 23-17 on Radio Songs (53 million, up 16 percent) and gains by 7 percent to 14.8 million streams (despite dropping 24-25 on Streaming Songs).

AMD revealed a fresh lineup of graphics cards on Tuesday, and the Radeon RX 500-series is a perfect complement to the company\u2019s new Ryzen 5 processors. What they aren\u2019t, however, are AMD\u2019s hotly anticipated Vega GPUs.\n\nInstead, the Radeon RX 500 series are based on the same Polaris graphics processors as the Radeon RX 400 series launched last year, with the exception of a new low-end GPU focused solely on e-sports and home theater PCs. \u201cPolaris refined and evolved,\u201d as AMD calls it.\n\nYep, they\u2019re tweaked refreshes, with one notable exception.\n\n[ Further reading: Best graphics cards for PC gaming ]\nWhile the term \"refresh\" typically sends shudders of apathy down enthusiasts' spines, the improvements AMD made moving from the RX 400 series to the RX 500 series are still notable\u2014mostly because they combat issues present in the original cards. The original Radeon RX 480, as great as it was, didn\u2019t offer much overclocking headroom above its 1,266MHz maximum boost speed. (Even factory-overclocked custom cards tapped out at a mere 40MHz to 50MHz boost.) A power-draw controversy struck the card at launch as well, though to its credit, AMD pushed out a rapid fix for the issue.\n\nlineup\nAMD\nThe Radeon RX 500 series is built using AMD\u2019s third-generation 14nm process, which lets the graphics cards achieve higher clock speeds than their predecessors. The Radeon RX 580, for example, packs a 1,257MHz base clock\u2014which is roughly the same as the RX 480\u2019s maximum clock\u2014and a 1,340MHz boost clock.\n\nAMD has also added a new power state, which allows the Radeon RX 500-series cards to consume less power at idle, while watching video, and while using multi-monitor setups. (Overall memory frequencies and bandwidth weren\u2019t increased, however.) Radeon representatives also stressed the significant power and temperature gains achievable in games that support the awesome Radeon Chill, which debuted with Radeon Crimson ReLive in December. AMD\u2019s working hard to whitelist games for Chill, and as part of the Radeon RX 500-series announcement, it revealed that the insanely popular League of Legends and Dota 2 are now compatible with the feature.\n\ncoolio\nAMD\nMeet the Radeon RX 500-series graphics cards\n\nBut enough blather! Here\u2019s the new Radeon lineup, from top to bottom. Any details not mentioned remain the same from the RX 400-series.\n\nThe Radeon RX 580 rocks a 1,256MHz base and 1,366MHz boost clock, as mentioned. Cranking those clocks brings the rated TDP up from 150W to 185W.\nThe Radeon RX 570 has a 1,168MHz base and 1,244MHz boost clock. While that\u2019s a mild increase from the Radeon RX 470\u2019s 1,206MHz maximum clock, it\u2019s a significant jump in base clocks, which was a mere 926MHz before. Again, that extra oomph isn\u2019t free, as the TDP increases from 120W to 150W.\nThe Radeon RX 560 provides a decent bump over the RX 460\u2019s 1,090MHz base/1,200MHz boost speeds, cranking things to 1,175MHz/1,275MHz, respectively. More notably, this is the full-fledged version of the Polaris 11 GPU. Whereas the RX 460 only packed 14 compute units (potentially to keep it under 75W, which is necessary for cards that don\u2019t require extra power pins), the RX 560 rocks the full 16. That combined with the clock-speed boosts means the RX 560 could offer decently more performance than the RX 460\u2014albeit at a higher power draw that will likely demand a 6-pin connector. Alas, AMD declined to share more details about this card.\nThe Radeon RX 550 is a completely new model designed to appeal to e-sports gamers and home theater PC aficionados looking for more than what integrated graphics alone can provide. It\u2019s essentially half of an RX 560 (or a third of an RX 570) with a mere eight compute units clocked at a 1,183MHz boost speed. AMD didn\u2019t reveal a base speed. It\u2019s got 2GB of memory over a 128-bit bus, though a limited number of models will offer 4GB capacity. It won\u2019t need a supplemental power connector, drawing all needed power through your motherboard.\nready\nAMD\nThe Radeon 550 highlights another reason for the existence of the Radeon RX 500 series. AMD's marketing materials don\u2019t compare the graphics cards against the RX 400 series, because frankly, that\u2019s not an upgrade worth spending your money on. Instead, AMD emphasizes how the RX 500 cards add a solid performance boost and worthwhile ecosystem features\u2014like support for FreeSync and modern, 4K-capable media codecs\u2014over the Radeon 300-series cards, and even older models. (For what it\u2019s worth, that was the same major hook the RX 460 offered.)\n\nDespite the appearance of the cards shown in some of the images above, there won\u2019t be any reference RX 500-series boards available. Instead, AMD\u2019s hardware partners (like Sapphire, XFX, Asus, et cetera) will be offering custom designs from day one\u2014which makes sense, as this is a refresh of an existing graphics architecture.\n\ncomp fps\nAMD\nAs far as pricing and release date info goes, the Radeon RX 570 and 580 go on sale today. The 4GB Radeon RX 570 carries a suggested e-tail price of $170, just like the RX 470; the Radeon RX 580, meanwhile, starts at $200 for a 4GB version and $230 for 8GB models. The $80 Radeon RX 550 will follow shortly after, on April 20; while the $100 will hit the streets in May.\n\nAttack of the clones\n\nLet\u2019s be honest: No gamer likes to see rebrands and minor iterations, especially when the world\u2019s been waiting for Vega for what seems like an eternity. But the Radeon RX 470 and 480 already delivered compelling value compared to Nvidia\u2019s (wildly different) 6GB GeForce GTX 1060 and 3GB GTX 1060, and that continued as drivers matured and supplies stopped being as limited as they were at the Polaris launch.\n\nLots of people are upgrading their PCs right now thanks to new competition on the CPU front. This Radeon release gives buyers the advantage of a refined manufacturing process, gives reviewers a reason to revisit mainstream Radeon cards, and lets AMD sell shiny \"new\" graphics cards to go with those shiny new Ryzen processors. It\u2019s not exciting whatsoever, but it\u2019s practical from a business standpoint, especially since we probably won't see new graphics card architectures from AMD or Nvidia any time in the immediate future.\n\nSo yeah, this is basically a repeat of the Radeon 300-series situation, but with memory speeds untouched.\n\nHead over to PCWorld\u2019s reviews of the Gigabyte Aorus RX 570 and the Sapphire RX 580 Nitro+ to see just where these new cards fall in the pecking order, and if you\u2019re waiting for Vega, well, just keep waiting. AMD still says those enthusiast-focused graphics cards are due to launch sometime before the end of June. In the meantime, check out PCWorld\u2019s in-depth interview with Radeon head Raja Koduri from CES on all things Vega, FreeSync 2, 4K gaming, and more in the video below.", "title": "AMD's Radeon RX 500-series graphics cards are a faster, better Polaris for new PCs", "link": "http://www.pcworld.com/article/3189591/components-graphics/amds-radeon-rx-500-series-graphics-cards-are-a-faster-better-polaris-for-new-pcs.html", "id": 44, "media": "PCWorld", "datetime": "2017/04/18 06:00"}, {"author": "James Trew", "content": "There are two things you should never do if you want to maintain productivity: start clicking on links in Wikipedia, or open Google Earth. There are many, many other ways to waste time on the internet but the amount of work hours lost between those two is probably enough to make most managers weep. Your boss won't be too pleased, then, to learn that Google Earth's latest update, revealed today, ratchets up its time-killing potential several notches.\n\nWe've come a long way since the earliest versions of Google Earth that basically placed a virtual globe in your desktop with some basic mapping and 3D tools. Today's revision sees a slew of new features that feel both exciting, and long overdue at the same time. The headline news, in my opinion, isn't technically a feature at all, but the fact that Google Earth is no longer a standalone app for desktop and mobile users, and can be accessed right from a browser (perfect for Chromebooks and education).\n\nThere are, of course, a lot of new things you can do with Google Earth that will give even the most experienced virtual tourist something fresh to explore. The first change you'll notice is the home page. No matter what machine you choose to open Google Earth on, you'll be presented a menu offering a series of icons: A ship's wheel, a die, a familiar highlight tag and a share symbol. The last two are somewhat self explanatory, but it's the first two where most of the fun stuff is.\n\nThe ship's wheel leads you to a section called \"Voyager.\" As that name suggests, this is all about discovery. Google Earth has kinda always been about finding and investigating, but Voyager is about enabling that encouraging that with curated content. Yes, even Google Earth isn't immune to the current trend for \"stories,\" or in this case, curated tales from around the world (literally). These stories are essentially themed journeys around the planet peppered with rich media such as 360 videos, and Street View (including inside buildings and underwater).\n\n\n\nGoogle partnered with the likes of DigitalGlobe and the BBC at launch to provide some of the more detailed stories, but we're told these will be regularly updated with new and increasingly more curious adventures. For now, though, the selection of around 40 available looks pretty good, with everything from touring Hemmingway's favorite haunts to a chance to meet girl muppets around the world (yep, check it out, much fun). Each \"voyage\" is usually about ten \"locations\" long, complete with swooping transition around the planet as you progress to the next spot.\n\nTwo other features that come along with Voyager, depending how you view it, are \"Itineraries\" (basically city guides with points of interest), and the option to send a virtual postcard from one of these locations. The postcard feature is unique to mobile (on desktop you'll just get a share link). A postcard is basically sending an image of a landmark from anywhere on the itinerary. Handy for showing people where to meet perhaps, or sharing a memory with family from a long-forgotten vacation.\n\nOnce you're done diving with sharks or exploring Charles Dickens' favorite pub, what happens if you run out of things to look at? Well, if you do, first, shame on you. Second the \"I'm feeling lucky\" feature (represented by the die icon) is for you. Google's been serving up random webpages with a button of the same name since as long as most of us can remember; Earth's version is much the same. Click the die, and you'll be digitally transported to a far-flung corner of the globe where Google will also serve up (the now ubiquitous) \"cards\" with local trivia.\n\nGoogle says it has identified about 20,000 locations so far, using its Knowledge Graph to serve up the info on \"Knowledge Cards.\" Much like stories, these locations will also be continually refreshed, so expect the number of random places (deliberately chosen off the beaten track) to grow with time. It's also possibly the best generator for spontaneous vacations we can think of. Especially if the location it takes you to doesn't initially convince you, simply click the paper plane icon on the Knowledge Card, and you'll be whisked off somewhere nearby with more info on that location as well.\n\n\n\nGoogle Earth has always been a great place to quench your wanderlust. As one company representative said \"You use Maps to find your way, Earth to get lost.\" This has never been more true than with the current iteration. In many ways it feels like the beginning of a constantly evolving, flexible version of Encarta. Right now you can't add your own stories, but you can be sure those types of features will be coming soon enough. When I asked about the potential for a \"Google Mars\" or a \"Google Solar System,\" one representative gave me the tortured look of someone that's excited about something, but cannot say (both of these somewhat exist already though don't forget).\n\nThere are, of course, a few things that the new Google Earth is not. And one of those is VR-friendly. It is still available on Steam, but given Google's investment in this area (DayDream, YouTube 360 etcetera), many hoped that today's announcement might have had even more of a virtual reality flavor. Alas, not this time, but again, you can be fairly sure this is somewhere on the roadmap.\n\nFor now though, Google Earth is growing beyond its position as a desktop curiosity, research tool and data hive, and into the world of original content, discovery and education. The fact that it now lives within your browser is no small thing. It's Chrome only for now, but Google did say that the base technology (Web Assembly) will soon be fully supported across all four main browsers, at which point you can use Google Earth for web on whatever tickles your fancy.\n\nOn mobile you'll still need to use a dedicated app, but you probably would prefer that anyway. And if you're worried that the move to a browser tab might mean compromises, don't be. Google claims about 90-percent of the codebase is the same, no matter how you choose to access it.\n\nIn this article: earth, gear, google, googleearth, internet, stories, streetview, voyager", "title": "Google Earth feeds your wanderlust with 'Voyager' stories", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/2017/04/18/google-earth-feeds-your-wanderlust-with-voyager-stories/", "id": 45, "media": "Engadget", "datetime": "2017/04/18 06:54"}, {"author": "Irene Klotz", "content": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. \u2014 An Orbital ATK cargo ship bound for the International Space Station is poised for liftoff Tuesday (April 18) aboard a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket.\n\nULA's 71st Atlas V rocket is scheduled for launch at 11:11 a.m. EDT (1511 GMT) from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.

The Advanced Plant Habitat, which is about the size of a mini refrigerator, includes more than 180 sensors to measure temperature, oxygen content and moisture levels.\n\nUnlike the station's existing plant-growth chamber, known as Veggie, the advanced greenhouse requires relatively little crew time to set up and operate, NASA officials said.\n\nInitially, the chamber will be used to germinate and grow test samples of wheat and Arabidopsis, a small flowering plant. The first science experiments are planned for November.\n\nSamples for several biomedical studies also will ride aboard the Cygnus, including an investigation to decrease the side effects of cancer-fighting chemotherapy drugs by incorporating antibodies that target only the diseased cells.\n\nThe capsule also is carrying 38 shoebox-size satellites called cubesats, four of which will remain on board the spacecraft and be deployed after it departs the station in July.\n\nIf Cygnus is launched as planned on Tuesday, it will linger in orbit until Saturday to allow time for a Russian Soyuz spacecraft, slated to lift off on Thursday with two new station crewmembers, to dock at the outpost.\n\nForecasters on Monday predicted a 90 percent chance the weather would be suitable for launch on Tuesday.

The pilot program is a coordinated effort between Trac-B Exchange, the Southern Nevada Health District and the Nevada AIDS Research and Education Society to discourage the sharing of needles among users.\n\nTrac-B Exchange program director Rick Reich said that to participate in the vending machine program, users would have to fill out a form for the sponsoring groups and obtain an eight-digit identification number to ensure confidentiality and track their use. Each kit will contain sterile syringes and needles \u2014 along with a compartment for used needles that can be disposed of safely at the machines.\n\nBut unlike snack, soda or movie rental machines left in open spaces, these $15,000 machines will be located inside the three facilities and would be accessed only during the hours the buildings are open for business. Reich said the cost of each kit was under $10, but they would be free for users.\n\nReich said putting one of the vending machines inside the Community Counseling Center of Southern Nevada was designed to allow some drug abusers to interact with trained counselors if they decided they wanted to get help.\n\nPatrick Bozarth, executive director of the counseling center, said his staff had been undergoing training in anticipation of reaching drug abusers who may use the vending machine and learn about treatment options.\n\n\u201cI think we're optimistic it will help,\u201d Bozarth said. \u201cBut it\u2019s such a new program and we want to make sure we\u2019re prepared.\u201d\n\nNeedle exchange programs have been used successfully throughout the world, with several nations adopting vending machine technology into their mix to curb the spread of blood-borne pathogens.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported the effectiveness of needle exchange programs, and the North American Needle Exchange Network counts 228 syringe service programs in 35 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe CDC reported on a study that looked at the effects of New York\u2019s exchange program on the prevalence of hepatitis C infection between 1990 and 2001, and found the needle exchange program reduced the disease\u2019s prevalence from 80% to 59% among intravenous drug users.\n\nNeedle and syringe possession was illegal in Nevada up until 2013, when the state Legislature repealed the law. Pharmacies can sell needles and syringes but have discretion about who can purchase them.\n\nReich said the machines helped remove some of the stigma faced by users who felt uncomfortable during transactions with pharmacists \u2014 some of whom may question why the syringe and needle are needed.\n\n\u201cVending machines are not born with a bias,\u201d Reich said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a personality and doesn\u2019t care how you look when you approach it.\u201d\n\nVending machines are not born with a bias.

A small percentage of needle users, she said, are transgender people using hormones or steroids.\n\nGratzke said she hoped users took advantage of the vending machines, but she acknowledged the initial rollout faced some challenges.\n\n\u201cIt does take time to gain the trust of the community,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people who are injecting the drugs have been stigmatized, and so I think they may be a little hesitant initially.

A new report from a well-known source of Apple-related leaks brings more details about this year\u2019s iPhone 8 and iPhone 7s series.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Apple is indeed working on three iPhones, including a flagship handset that will have an OLED display taking up the entire front side of the handset.\n\nApple will also launch two iPhone 7s models that will represent slight revisions of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. They will have the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screens as their predecessors. All three 2017 iPhones will be powered by Apple\u2019s 10nm A11 chips, which are supposed to be more powerful and more energy energy efficient than the 16nm A10 Fusion CPU in the iPhone 7.\n\nThe report notes that Apple has been testing several designs for the iPhone 8, as is the case for every iPhone. Just like most of the recent iPhone 8 reports, Bloomberg also says that supply constraints might force Apple to delay the iPhone 8 by one or two months.\n\nThe iPhone 8 should feature a stainless steel chassis covered by curved glass on the back and front \u2014 previous reports also said the iPhone 8 will feature an iPhone 4-like glass sandwich design. The sources who talked to Bloomberg, said the iPhone 8\u2019s feature and design plans are still in flux and can change.\n\nOne of the latest prototypes includes \u201csymmetrical, slightly curved glass on the front and the back,\u201d covering a flat OLED screen. An earlier prototype apparently had a thinner steel band and \u201cmore noticeable\u201d curved glass on the sides. Apple also tested a prototype that had a glass back with more dramatic curves on the top and bottom, similar to the original iPhone design from 2007. Finally, Apple also has a prototype that packs an aluminum back, and has slightly larger dimensions.\n\nGlass suppliers have been struggling to produce heavily curved glass, which is why Apple is more likely to use \u201cmore subdued curves\u201d for the handset.\n\nThe iPhone 8 should be about as big as the iPhone 7, while packing a screen as big as the iPhone 7 Plus\u2019s display.\n\nThe report notes that there won\u2019t be a phone button in the iPhone 8, and its features will be mapped to the screen. Apple wants to integrate the iPhone\u2019s fingerprint sensor into the OLED screen, but the procedure is \u201ctechnically challenging.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if the feature will make it in the final product.\n\nSignificant camera changes are also in the works. The rear camera will have two lenses complete with a camera bump, just like the iPhone 7 Plus, but they will be positioned vertically. On the front, Apple will use a dual camera setup, which may be placed under the screen. Apple is using Sony cameras for the new iPhone, and it\u2019s looking into adding augmented reality and depth-of-field features to the camera systems.", "title": "Bloomberg details new iPhone 8 design, says release may be delayed", "link": "http://bgr.com/2017/04/18/iphone-8-release-date-delay-bloomberg/", "id": 50, "media": "BGR", "datetime": "2017/04/18 07:45"}]
