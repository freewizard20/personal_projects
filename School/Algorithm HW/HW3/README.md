# Configuring Strongly Connected Components of a graph.

Do SCC algorithm with three different graph representations : matrix, adjacency list, adjacency array

* check runtime of dense and sparse graphs
* check runtime by number of nodes

# Speciality

* Made a fully iterative algorithm to remove stack overflow from recursion depths.
