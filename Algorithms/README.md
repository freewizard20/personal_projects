## Solving Algorithm Problems

1. Write down the conditions
2. Structure the algorithm on paper
3. Check for edge cases
4. Code
5. Debug/Read your code
* is the algorithm correct?
* did you read your code?
* did you simlate your code?
* did you think about edge cases?

## Algorithm topics
* searching
* sorting
* graph
* bit
* pattern searching
* geometric
* mathematical
* probability
* game theory

## Data structure topics
* Array
* List
* Stack
* Queue
* Tree
* Hash
* Graph
* String
* Matrix
* Advanced

## fast I/O
* C++
```
cin.tie(null)
ios::sync_with_stdio(false)
```

## How to run

these code may not run. try :

* for c/cpp programs

  ` g++ -o {{executable name}} {{code file name}}`
  
* for java programs(on windows. for linux, no need for encoding/classpath flags)

` javac {{java file name}} -encoding UTF8`

`java -classpath . {{Main class name}}`

* for node.js algorithms

`node {{filename}}`

You may need to modify fs.readFileSync directory if in other than Linux. You can use a text input.
