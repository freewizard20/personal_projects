# Algorithm practice and implementations

## How to run

these code may not run. try :

* for c/cpp programs

  ` g++ -o {{executable name}} {{code file name}}`
  
* for java programs(on windows. for linux, no need for encoding/classpath flags)

` javac {{java file name}} -encoding UTF8`

`java -classpath . {{Main class name}}`

* for node.js algorithms

`node {{filename}}`

You may need to modify fs.readFileSync directory if in other than Linux. You can use a text input.

## Postscript : 

**I do hand coding;** *Many more problems solved on whiteboards, many more solved on paper. Hand coding gives you fundamental strength on programming*
