# Algorithm basics

## fast I/O
* C++ : use '\n'
```
cin.tie(null)
ios::sync_with_stdio(false)
```
* Python

## Solving Algorithm Problems

1. Write down the conditions
2. Structure the algorithm on paper
3. Check for edge cases
4. Code
5. Debug/Read your code
* is the algorithm correct?
* did you read your code?
* did you simlate your code?
* did you think about edge cases?
